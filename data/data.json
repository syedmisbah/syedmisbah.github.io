        "body": "Long-time lurker here. Closing in on 32 years in the field.\n\nPosting this after seeing the steady stream of AI threads claiming programming will soon be obsolete or effortless. I think those discussions miss the point.\n\nFred Brooks wrote in the 1980s that no single breakthrough will make software development 10x easier (\u201cNo Silver Bullet\u201d). Most of the difficulty lies in the problem itself, not in the tools. The hard part is the essential complexity of the requirements, not the accidental complexity of languages, frameworks, or build chains.\n\nCoding is the boring\/easy part. Typing is just transcribing decisions into a machine. The real work is upstream: understanding what\u2019s needed, resolving ambiguity, negotiating tradeoffs, and designing coherent systems. By the time you\u2019re writing code, most of the engineering is (or should be) already done.\n\nThat\u2019s the key point often missed when people talk about vibe coding, no-code, low-code, etc.\n\nOnce requirements are fully expressed, their information content is fixed. You can change surface syntax, but you can\u2019t compress semantics without losing meaning. Any further \u201ccompression\u201d means either dropping obligations or pushing missing detail back to a human.\n\nSo when people say \u201cAI will let you just describe what you want and it will build it,\u201d they\u2019re ignoring where the real cost sits. Writing code isn\u2019t the cost. Specifying unambiguous behavior is. And AI can guess it as much or as little as we can.\n\nIf vibe coding or other shorthand feels helpful, that\u2019s because we\u2019re still fighting accidental complexity: boilerplate, ceremony, incidental constraints. Those should be optimized away.\n\nBut removing accidental complexity doesn\u2019t touch the essential kind. If the system must satisfy 200 business rules across 15 edge cases and 6 jurisdictions, you still have to specify them, verify them, and live with the interactions. No syntax trick erases that.\n\nStrip away the accidental complexity and the boundaries between coding, low-code, no-code, and vibe coding collapse. They\u2019re all the same activity at different abstraction levels: conveying required behavior to an execution engine. Different skins, same job.\n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth: anyone who can fully express the requirements and a sound solution is, as far as I\u2019m concerned, a software engineer, whether they do it in C++ or plain English.\n\nTL;DR: The bottleneck is semantic load, not keystrokes. Brooks called it \u201cessential complexity.\u201d Information theory calls it irreducible content. Everything else is tooling noise.",

Is there any investment in higher education by the system? None. And if they somehow get a break in a University of Delhi, how is their family supposed to manage the cost of their travel, books, clothing, food? \n\nThe sad reality is, the system needs us to glorify hard working poor people, so it can sell us all the dream.

        "body": "I just went through a pretty grueling but ultimately successful interview process for a senior role at a product-based startup here in India and wanted to share the details while they're fresh. The focus was way less on LeetCode grinding and much more on real-world experience, architectural reasoning, and handling production failures. Hope this helps others who are prepping.\n\n  \n**Round 1: The Forensic Project Deep Dive & Practical Coding**\n\n\n\nThis round was a 90-minute interrogation of my resume. The interviewer had clearly read my project descriptions in detail. We went through my last major project, and for every tech choice, I had to justify it.\n\n**The key areas they drilled down on:**\n\n* **Architecture & Microservices:**\n   * \"You used microservices. Why was that the right choice? What was your inter-service communication strategy (REST vs. gRPC vs. Message Queue) and why?\"\n   * \"How did you handle distributed transactions or sagas? Give me a concrete example.\"\n* **Databases & Caching (The \"Why This Tech?\" Game):**\n   * \"You used Redis for caching. Why not Memcached? What Redis data structures did you use and why were they optimal?\"\n   * \"Explain your Cassandra data model. How did you design the partition key to support your main query patterns? If you had to add a new query pattern that the key doesn't support, what's your zero-downtime migration strategy?\"\n   * \"Tell me about a time you had to optimize a slow database query. What were the steps you took?\"\n* **Spring Boot Internals:**\n   * This went beyond just building APIs. Questions included:\n   * \"Explain Spring's Transaction Propagation levels. When would you explicitly use `REQUIRES_NEW`?\"\n   * \"How would you implement an idempotent API endpoint to handle client retries safely?\"\n   * \"When does it make sense to create a custom Spring Boot Starter\/Auto-Configuration for your team?\"\n* **Containerization & Deployment:**\n   * \"Walk me through the most complex Dockerfile you've written. Why did you use a multi-stage build?\"\n   * \"What's the difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` and when would you use both?\"\n   * \"When should a project use Kubernetes vs. a simpler Docker Compose setup? What's the tipping point?\"\n\nThe round ended with a medium-level Greedy algorithm problem on a shared editor. They seemed more focused on my thought process, edge cases, and communication than just getting to the perfect code.\n\n**Verdict:** Got the call for Round 2 the next day.\n\n\n\n# Round 2: System Design Under Fire (Failure is an Expectation)\n\n\n\nThis was a 2-hour system design round, but it felt more like a \"production incident simulation.\" The initial prompt was standard: \"Design a scalable notification service.\" But it quickly devolved into chaos engineering.\n\n**Some of the killer questions:**\n\n* **Core Design & Scalability:**\n   * \"Design the system to send 1 million push notifications per minute. Sketch the architecture. What are the bottlenecks?\"\n   * \"Your database connection pool is exhausted during a traffic spike. What is the user experience? How does your application behave? What specific configurations would you tune to mitigate this?\"\n* **Handling Failure & Race Conditions:**\n   * \"Your Redis cache cluster goes down entirely. How does your system degrade gracefully? What's the immediate recovery plan?\"\n   * \"Describe a subtle race condition that could cause a user to receive the same notification twice. How would you prevent it at the application, cache, and database levels?\"\n   * \"We're seeing frequent deadlocks in our PostgreSQL database during peak load. What are the common causes and how would you start debugging this in a production environment?\"\n* **The \"Everything is Broken\" Scenarios:**\n   * \"You just pushed a bad code change that is causing your service to crash loop. The deployment pipeline is stuck. What are your first 5 steps?\"\n   * \"A bad data migration was just merged and is actively corrupting user data. What's your immediate rollback plan? How do you communicate the impact to non-technical stakeholders?\"\n\nThis round was all about proving you could be trusted with a system in production. Your ability to stay calm, diagnose systematically, and communicate clearly was just as important as your design skills.\n\n**Verdict:** Got the offer this morning!\n\n**My main takeaway:** For experienced roles in good product companies, your ability to articulate the *why* behind your decisions and demonstrate experience with real-world failures is your biggest asset. They weren't hiring a framework expert; they were hiring an owner.\n\n\n\n  \nShoot your Question if any, or Any Guidance Needed, LMK",

It scares me, because currently there is no mechanism that exists which can solve this issue. It's a type of tragedy by definition.\n\nIf someone steals something from Walmart, then I think we can all understand what a proportionate punishment for that is both legally and socially. Legally maybe they are forced to pay a small fine, maybe some community service time, maybe some short jail time. Socially maybe your friends\/family treat you a bit differently for a bit, but time will probably heal those relationships if the person doesn't repeat the behavior.\n\nBut if someone steals something Walmart and for some reason that event goes viral on the internet, then anyone who googles their name will see it. It will ruin their life. They will struggle to get jobs, because the employers will google their name and see that. Everyone in their town and country will know them as \"the person who stole from Walmart\". They will have to go into hiding, like these people probably are right now, to avoid reporters. Eventually the attention will cool off, but they'll never be able to completely escape it. That's a level of punishment that *far* exceeds what is warranted for the wrongdoing committed, yet the internet does it without any concern or thought or feelings of guilt. The users of the internet *don't even realize they're doing this.* It's just this phenomenon that happens in a tragic way where no individual person is responsible for this disproportionate punishment but rather it's millions of people contributing ever so slightly. Even us right now in this reddit thread are partially responsible for the disproportionate punishment that these 2 people are facing, because by being here and engaging with the post we increase its exposure and keep the story alive longer. None of us set out to do that consciously, but that's what is happening.\n\nAnd I just hope that one day we recognize this as an issue even if it only affects a very small percentage who happen to get very unlucky by something they did going viral. This is an injustice that *we're the cause of*, although I have no idea what the solution would be. First step is for everyone to acknowledge this as a real issue.",

I work with folks from other countries as well in limited personal capacity and in those cases we can really trust each other with work and money, even without having anything in written. Although even there, the relationship is transaction based - work vs money, and trust is probably based on the quality of work or sense of responsibility, still feels less toxic and more open.\n\nP.S.

It's all entertainment at the end of the day. They serve no one but themselves while putting on a front that they need your support. What they actually mean is your money and stupidity. Treat them for their worth. Stop idolizing or worshipping them like they give a rats ass about your pitiful life. They don't.\n\nSports is mere entertainment, just like movies. The sportsmen and everyone involved in the business play, or lose, either way, they make CRORES while you go home with just a fleeting feeling that won't mean shit at the end of the day unless you're placing bets to secure your future. Stop putting them on a pedestal. **Have some self respect**. They're no supreme beings. They're just like any other human who are good at their craft, It's a job for them, just like businessmen, actors, politicians, software devs, singers, drivers, etc. Take away the money and they will soon stop begging for your \"loyalty\".\n\nIf your life is so shallow that you need to join a tribe, gather and cheer for fellow human beings that you contributed ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for their success, you need to reevaluate life. Take a hike in nature alone. May be do some introspection. Realise that your worth is just as much as any other human being and stop worshipping others who do no tangible good to the society. Realise that there's more to life than trying to fit in with others. Realise that there's more to than entertainment.\n\nDon't be a sheep to false idols. Dear be a slave to FOMO. It's okay not to follow sports or cheer for your \"local team\" with such gusto. It's okay not to watch your favorite actor's movie first day, first show while you shower his portrait with flowers and milk. In short, stop trying too hard to fit in to a circlejerk. It's utterly meaningless to the progress of humanity.\n\nThis stupidity has cost lives today. I'm sure it will continue to do so until people realise their worth.\n\nRIP to the fallen. Sad that a victory had to be marred with blood. The city did indeed bleed red today, just not in the way the stupid \"fans\" wanted to. Hope you take some responsibility of this clusterfuck and introspect for change.",

        "body": "*This post was refactored using ChatGPT*\n\nI've worked at various startups for past three years ( some failed) and in no way I'm an experienced engineer but I'm only here to share my experience in working as a founding engineer at an early stage startup.\n\nI joined my current startup straight out of college in January 2024 as an AI Engineer. Six months in, our first idea flat-lined. We still had **two full years of runway**, but none of us wanted to watch those 24 months evaporate on the wrong bet. We pivoted, built the new MVP in **one month**, and that second swing is already pacing **$100 K ARR** after just two months in market.\n\nBelow is what changed in my head\u2014and in my Git history\u2014during that ride.\n\n# 1. Good teams outrun bad ideas\n\nWhen the pivot surfaced, cash wasn\u2019t the issue\u2014**morale** was. I stayed because I\u2019d seen the founders kill pet projects the moment data disagreed and close small deals on pure hustle. If you\u2019re weighing a founding seat, ask how people behave when a customer says *no*. That instinct predicts survival better than any TAM slide.\n\n# 2. Question everything\u2014out loud\n\nFrom roadmap to naming conventions, every *why* was fair game. Pushing back publicly caught blind spots early and built a shared product mindset: no one hid behind \u201cjust the engineer\u201d; code and commercial thinking travelled together.\n\n# 3. Radical candor > silent resentment\n\nAny friction with leadership went straight to them the same day\u2014no stewing, no side-channel gossip. Problems were welcome; politics weren\u2019t. Performance reviews became five-minute chats because nothing nasty had time to ferment.\n\n# 4. Be a Swiss Army knife\n\nEarly-stage teams don\u2019t have \u201cfront-end folks,\u201d \u201cinfra folks,\u201d or \u201cdata folks.\u201d They have *folks.* One sprint I wired up auth; the next I optimised a query I\u2019d never seen before. \u201cNot my domain\u201d is corporate luxury\u2014be ready to learn, ship, and move on.\n\n# 5. Pick the stack your team dreams in\n\nWe shipped with tools everyone understood best (React on the front end, a Node-based framework on the back end, document DB under the hood). **Latency from idea \u2192 prod was measured in hours, not sprints.** Infra upgrades happened only when real load forced the decision\u2014never \u201cjust in case.\u201d\n\n*Litmus test*: if a new hire can\u2019t clone, install, and run the app in under 30 minutes, you built a museum piece, not a product.\n\n# 6. RUG over DRY\u2014Repeat Until Good\n\nI rewrote the same email parser three times because requirements mutated faster than I could generalize them. Early-stage code is compost: throw scraps in quickly, refactor when the smell becomes unbearable. When a feature survives three releases unchanged, *then* I hunt abstractions.\n\n# 7. Ship the walking skeleton, not the dinosaur\n\nOur first paying customer saw a UI with two buttons and a notebook-grade error log. They still paid because it solved one painful workflow. That cheque funded hardening the edges.\n\nCorollary: **tests follow traction.** Smoke tests guarded the checkout flow; unit coverage grew only after feature churn slowed. Writing tests against shifting sand is masochism.\n\n# 8. Feature flags cost five lines\u2014panic costs more\n\nA new OAuth flow once broke a client\u2019s workspace. Flipping the flag limited blast radius to ten users and saved our reputation. Anything scarier than a CSS tweak now ships behind a toggle.\n\n# 9. Talk to users until it\u2019s awkward\n\nI book 15-minute \u201cwatch-me-use-it\u201d calls with anyone who signs up. Seeing real frustration shapes the backlog better than any dashboard. **Engineers who witness user pain write kinder code.**\n\n# 10. Guard psychological runway\n\nWhile friends flashed FAANG badges on LinkedIn, I kept a Notion page titled *Reasons We Won\u2019t Die*\u2014first Stripe charge, first unsolicited Slack DM, first user who said \u201cthis saved my Sunday.\u201d Proof beats impostor syndrome more reliably than caffeine.\n\n# 11. Revenue beats vanity metrics\n\nPage views felt good; $9,465 in the bank felt existentially better. Once money arrived, planning sessions changed: no more guessing willingness to pay\u2014we argued how to double a number we\u2019d already proved.\n\n# 12. Burnout comes in waves\u2014surf accordingly\n\nWhen usage spiked and servers wheezed, I logged 16-hour days for a week. The following Monday I took a guilt-free 36-hour digital detox. Startups aren\u2019t marathons; they\u2019re interval training. Sprint, ship, rest, repeat.\n\n# 13. Spread knowledge faster than you write code\n\nEvery Friday I drop a two-minute Loom: *what shipped + why*. Product, sales, and support watch it at 1.5\u00d7 speed, and questions vanish. **Knowledge hoarded is value wasted**; sharing it buys leverage and respect.\n\n# 14. Leave room for luck\n\nOur jump from $0 \u2192 $100 K ARR hinged on one early adopter tweeting a rave review. You can\u2019t schedule serendipity, but you can improve its odds: keep onboarding frictionless and respond faster than any competitor. Word-of-mouth only spreads when users feel heard.\n\nClosing thought\n\nIf we\u2019d waited to craft pristine code, we\u2019d still be debugging the dead V1. Instead I\u2019m busy refactoring the messy modules that pay our salaries. **Early-stage engineering is measured in revenue and learning, not elegance.** Make it work first; beautify it after someone proves it matters.\n\nHope these reflections help you dodge a few headaches\u2014or at least normalise them.

        "body": "So yeah now it works with OpenAI compatible endpoints thanks to the kind work of people on the Github who updated it for me here is a recap of the project:  \n  \nAutomated-AI-Web-Researcher: After months of work, I've made a python program that turns local LLMs running on Ollama into online researchers for you, Literally type a single question or topic and wait until you come back to a text document full of research content with links to the sources and a summary and ask it questions too! and more!\n\n**What My Project Does**:\n\nThis automated researcher uses internet searching and web scraping to gather information, based on your topic or question of choice, it will generate focus areas relating to your topic designed to explore various aspects of your topic and investigate various related aspects of your topic or question to retrieve relevant information through online research to respond to your topic or question. The LLM breaks down your query into up to 5 specific research focuses, prioritising them based on relevance, then systematically investigates each one through targeted web searches and content analysis starting with the most relevant.\n\nThen after gathering the content from those searching and exhausting all of the focus areas, it will then review the content and use the information within to generate new focus areas, and in the past it has often finding new, relevant focus areas based on findings in research content it has already gathered (like specific case studies which it then looks for specifically relating to your topic or question for example), previously this use of research content already gathered to develop new areas to investigate has ended up leading to interesting and novel research focuses in some cases that would never occur to humans although mileage may vary this program is still a prototype but shockingly it, it actually works!.\n\nKey features:\n\n* Continuously generates new research focuses based on what it discovers\n* Saves every piece of content it finds in full, along with source URLs\n* Creates a comprehensive summary when you're done of the research contents and uses it to respond to your original query\/question\n* Enters conversation mode after providing the summary, where you can ask specific questions about its findings and research even things not mentioned in the summary should the research it found provide relevant information about said things.\n* You can run it as long as you want until the LLM\u2019s context is at it\u2019s max which will then automatically stop it\u2019s research and still allow for summary and questions to be asked. Or stop it at anytime which will cause it to generate the summary.\n* But it also Includes pause feature to assess research progress to determine if enough has been gathered, allowing you the choice to unpause and continue or to terminate the research and receive the summary.\n* Works with popular Ollama local models (recommended phi3:3.8b-mini-128k-instruct or phi3:14b-medium-128k-instruct which are the ones I have so far tested and have worked)\n* Everything runs locally on your machine, and yet still gives you results from the internet with only a single query you can have a massive amount of actual research given back to you in a relatively short time.\n\nThe best part? You can let it run in the background while you do other things. Come back to find a detailed research document with dozens of relevant sources and extracted content, all organised and ready for review. Plus a summary of relevant findings AND able to ask the LLM questions about those findings. Perfect for research, hard to research and novel questions that you can\u2019t be bothered to actually look into yourself, or just satisfying your curiosity about complex topics!\n\nGitHub repo with full instructions and a demo video:\n\n[https:\/\/github.com\/TheBlewish\/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama](https:\/\/github.com\/TheBlewish\/Automated-AI-Web-Researcher-Ollama)\n\n(Built using Python, fully open source, and should work with any Ollama-compatible LLM, although only phi 3 has been tested by me)\n\n**Target Audience**:\n\nAnyone who values locally run LLMs, anyone who wants to do comprehensive research within a single input, anyone who like innovative and novel uses of AI which even large companies (to my knowledge) haven't tried yet.\n\nIf your into AI, if your curious about what it can do, how easily you can find quality information using it to find stuff for you online, check this out!\n\n**Comparison**:\n\nWhere this differs from per-existing programs and applications, is that it conducts research continuously with a single query online, for potentially hundreds of searches, gathering content from each search, saving that content into a document with the links to each website it gathered information from.\n\nAgain potentially hundreds of searches all from a single query, not just random searches either each is well thought out and explores various aspects of your topic\/query to gather as much usable information as possible.\n\nNot only does it gather this information, but it summaries it all as well, extracting all the relevant aspects of the info it's gathered when you end it's research session, it goes through all it's found and gives you the important parts relevant to your question. Then you can still even ask it anything you want about the research it has found, which it will then use any of the info it has gathered to respond to your questions.\n\nTo top it all off compared to other services like how ChatGPT can search the internet, this is completely open source and 100% running locally on your own device, with any LLM model of your choosing although I have only tested Phi 3, others likely work too!",

I\u2019m not going to stress over it. There\u2019s no point in having nice cars if I panic about them constantly\u201c.\n\nI responded with something along the lines of \u201csure, until a metro bus veers into it at full speed and absolutely totals it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTotals it?\u201d He responded \u201cmy friend\u2026 That car could be nothing but a frame and half a transmission, and it would cost less to rebuild it from the ground up to perfect condition than the value of that car. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m not worried about happening to that car. I could pay out-of-pocket to fully rebuild it and still sell it for more than I spent. That\u2019s why I drive that one more than most of the others.\u201d\n\nI socialize with some very interesting people sometimes, and some of them are actually really good folks that I enjoy the company of, but a few of of them exist in the world where money has an absolutely frightening level of non-significance\u2026\n\nEdit: apparently when you use voice to text, recount a story from memory, and don\u2019t bother proofreading it very hard after, everyone assumes you\u2019re either AI or just really bad at telling a story because they\u2019re too busy picking apart HOW you said things (do you mean to tell me you\u2019ve never paraphrased a conversation from memory for retelling?) instead of WHAT you said. whatever I guess, believe what you guys want\u2026 Doesn\u2019t bother me one bit if you believe me or not.

Punch them in the eye if possible. \n- Set up SOS numbers on your phone. \n- Carry a liquid pepper spray. \n- If you stay on the lower floors, ground to 2nd. Keep your doors and windows locked. Unless there are sturdy grills installed for windows. Then you can take a call. \n- If there is a dark area near your door, either install a light or check it before entry. Preferably install a light.\n- When you enter your  house, enter quickly and lock the door first, even before taking off your shoes or dumping bags. \n- If you find him following you again, get into a public place with loads of people. \n- Don't open your door before checking who it is. \n- Once you enter your house, don't turn your lights on for a few minutes.

        "body": "**Storytime**\n\nThere we were, Jester and I, fresh out of training squadron VF-101 (Grim Reapers). This was our first Nellis detachment as part of the Swordsmen of VF-32, and everything looked great as we prepared for our first visit to the range. The plan was simple: take off from Nellis carrying four Rockeye cluster bombs, plus a pair each of Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles for self-defence, fly to the VORTAC at Beatty through Creech AFB then head north to the range, dropping the bombs at medium altitude smack dab in the heart of a hot target. The Air Force specialised enemy equipment squadrons made sure to get prepare a nasty area for us, and Red Air was to be courtesy of the Red Eagles chaps flying out of the shady corners of Tonopah. On the way back we were to refuel with a USAF KC-135 and recover at Nellis. No big deal, right?\n\nThe way there was routine, coming in at FL240 and arming the bombs and missiles 30 miles off the target. The radar warning receiver accused the identity of the Red Eagles of the day - MiG-19P 'Farmer' interceptors, old technology but still a formidable dogfighter, and particularly dangerous for those busy down the heads-up display aiming bombs or dodging anti-aircraft artillery. My backseater Jester set the final touches as we approached and started a shallow dive towards the prescribed release altitude of 10,000 feet - we would drop all four canisters at once, with intervals so they drop 50 metres from each other. Combined with the area effect of an individual bomb, this would create an umbrella of bomblets at our target. Not fun for anyone there except us!\n\nWe acquired the target visually, identified the building next to the truck park and as the pipper intersected it I hit the pickle button. It went smooth as ever, all four bombs cleared with a thump and we started egressing westwards while jinking in response to what felt like a dozen \"AAA\" tracking radar warnings. As luck would have it the MiG-19s were on the far end of their patrol orbit as we struck, oblivious to our presence until the bombs hit the ground. Without any SAM warnings to our name and no fighters on our tail, as soon as we cleared the area I climbed back to FL240 while scanning the instruments and warning lights for anything abnormal. We'd made it through hell without as much as a scratch!\n\nIt would and should have been great news, except fighter pilots can get a little... creative, when there's not enough adrenaline involved. Jester called the MiG-19s were now in pursuit. I knew they were about 20 miles behind us and were no factor, but a quick glance showed we had plenty of fuel, plus four missiles and a full cannon load to play with. The plan was made on the fly - turn around, shoot some Sparrows before they even see what hit them, kill both and run home, easy as that. Or so I thought.\n\nInitially it seemed like I was right - we turned into the Farmers, Jester locked the first one and I fired a valid Sparrow shot that connected. However, the wingman which I expected to be in trail quickly behind him was actually abreast, and I was lost for words when he disappeared from the radar scope. A long-range turkey shoot had just developed into a dogfight, and I was blind on the enemy. To make matters worse, I had re-entered the engagement range of the air defences on the target, so the \"AAA\" light was blinking like there's no tomorrow and we were forced to jink instead of searching properly.\n\nWhen we did find the enemy he was directly behind us and closing. So much for a couple of easy kills. Our predicament continued to deteriorate when, as we prepared to turn the tables on the bandit, a Soviet-built SA-3 site that we thought was offline launched a missile at us. Down to the deck we went, making SAM lose us in the ground clutter but also losing the MiG in the process. We tried to run west hugging the desert floor but the bandit showed up behind us again, so I did a magnificent climbing turn to reverse onto the bandit... until the SAM fired at us. The Farmer found our tail once more and tried to hit us with a missile, but we dodged that and the SAM in one go. This was taking a lot longer than planned, but at least I'd now managed to fly out of SAM range and start heading westwards. With the MiG still hell-bent in killing us though, we had to fight our way out, and fight we did. For 6 exhausting minutes, we tangled in an endless set of rolling scissors, pulling Gs and plugging the burner to try and get an edge on each other to no avail. After the Farmer slacked on a turn I managed to break away from him and started extending towards the tanker. The enemy, probably low on fuel and unable to use the burner to give chase, turned tail after another 2 minutes.\n\nNow we had time to breathe, except the fuel gauge gave us the bad news - we had 1200 pounds of fuel, the tanker sat at 50 miles away and was turned away from us, and the nearest military airfields were bloody Groom Lake - **Area 51** - and the Tonopah Test Range, both restricted airspace Air Force facilities that would certainly not welcome us there. Since we liked our jobs, that option went out of the window. The tanker was maybe within reach, but with a solid chance of flaming out as we approached it or if I failed to plug in immediately, meaning an ejection over the charmingly-named \"Death Valley\". With only seconds to make a decision, the map indicated an uncontrolled airstrip near Beatty, our original ingress point earlier today, about 20 miles away. It seemed like the safest shot to save the jet, so we turned in and flew an uneventful straight-in approach against the wind. The runway was barely wide enough to keep both the Tomcat's wheels on concrete, and right as we turned to clear it the familiar sound of engines shutting off came. Turns out we'd made it by 30 seconds or so! After opening the cockpit and shutting off the jet, it was time to figure out how to deliver the news to the boss that we'd need some JP-5 and a Tomcat starter cart delivered to Middle Of Nowhere, Nevada.\n\nThis, folks, is why you go home after the job is done!",

Doesn't scale much after that. \n\nSpecialist salaries are funnier. 60k for fresher or sometimes 80k depending on your luck. 1L in 2 years and 1.5L in 10 years and won't scale much after that. Keep jumping ship to push it to 2L but you have a high chance of being fired. \n\nThis is the reality for 90% of doctors. \n\nForgot, if you have a super speciality, please add a generous 10k to the above numbers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh you know a richie rich doctor or have family who only buy Rolls Royce undies. Well, take a good look in the mirror and now look around your 150 batch class. One of you is going to be F1 team owning, KF airlines baron, king of good times - Vijay Mallya of your batch. Only ONE. The rest of you are also going to be Vijay Mallya but the UK one, living modestly having been humbled by reality.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay you are special and not going to be living with modest means with modest renumeration. You are the ONE. The neo of your batch. Well, just finished your masters? It's time to prepare for fellowships. Well congratulations on finishing one. Wait, just one, you need another fellowship. You can do it, age is just a number, 35 is another number. Well, the fellowships are not really that much of an achievement, how about some foreign fellowships spending 10 lakhs of your savings. Save 20L for the next year too. How about some work experience in UK or Australia? \n\nCongratulation, you just hit 40 and because you are in the medical field your body aged to 50. Come back to India for that sweet 10L per month salary. Wait corporate offering your a better package, no salary and only cuts. You are confused as to what that means! You haggle and settle on a 5L per month salary. Oh you now have to compete with 100 others who have followed the same formula. Corporates were waiting for your arrival so they can replace their current 10L one with the fresh 5L recruit. \n\nThe move was so stressful that they increased the OPD charges for everyone. The calculation so difficult that your salary actually decreased. The formula they use where patients pay hospital more money, so doctors get less and less pay is a proprietary algorithm. You have more luck accessing Googles Lambda  algorithm. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is another final way. Ingredients needed, money and power. Most people have neither. If you a middle class doctor then, this is a very heavy door for you to open. Not impossible but extremely difficult. Well, still if you arrange for 10cr or atleast 2.5cr and find 3 more partners. Open a hospital. Keep 3cr out of that for bribes, running costs and political handouts. Wait 3 years and voila, you are earning 10lakh per month. 80% chance you will fail but, it's better to try. A corporate might bail you out and pay you 50lakhs for your initial investment. \n\nLife expectancy of a doctor is 59. If you are running a hospital while also practicing, then good luck crossing 60.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't think just because your mom calls you Sharukh Khan or Ranbir Kapoor, it's true. You are most likely Shreyas Talpade or Tusshar Kapoor.

If the same have been leaked to a social media platform such as Discord or Reddit, contact the platform moderators via e-mail or other means and seek immediate removal.\n3. Go to [cybercime.gov.in](https:\/\/cybercrime.gov.in\/), and file a cybercrime complaint against the concerned individual, referencing all possible evidence you might possess linking them to the leak.\n4. Write a complaint to the National Commission for Women (**NCW**), detailing your plight and referencing all possible evidence.\n\nThe cybercrime complaint will escalate the matter from a criminal law perspective.

When she says \"he was not ready for marriage\", you can extrapolate that they had fights and he disappointed her in some way. When someone you deeply trust disappoints you, it is traumatic. Most people do not acknowledge this. She will not trust you like she did her ex, because the trauma from her previous relationship has spilled over into this one.\n\nThe first step is to get her to acknowledge that something is missing. The approach here is to communicate. Your concerns are valid. You have to learn to make her empathize with you. Explain how you feel, and ask her if she thinks this is fair. If you think she will go into defence mode impulsively, tell her that you don't want an answer. That you just want her to think about it. Tell her that you want to make it work, but that this is not enough. and that you expect more from her. If she agrees that there is something missing, work with her to fix it.\n\nThere is a chance that none of this will work. If that's the case, you may need to get used to a loveless marriage or get a divorce.\n\nHonestly, I feel sorry for you. You were a little too naive in choosing to marry someone with a relationship of 10 years (when you never had a relationship), but you don't deserve this. It breaks my heart to see a fellow human deprived of the joys of having a spouse who loves them the same. Maybe it is because I see a lot of my younger self in you.

        "body": "**Motivation**\n\nI have seen a flurry of posts from school kids asking about comparisons of \"scopes\" of different branches. And among many of the branches mentioned, civil engineering.\n\nWhat's more saddening than the lack of interest in the branch among the young, is the responses from civil engineering graduates who either have not become a civil engineer yet and are still in the job hunt phase or from those who ultimately ended up in the IT services sector because that's what their institution was offering in terms of \"placements\". Its a long drive from being an \"engineering graduate\" to becoming an \"actual engineer\" - a fact that most people today don't seem to appreciate any more.\n\nThe problem according to me is that people aren't questioning facts and opinions that are being peddled as laws of nature - that civil engineering is not a good career and you are better off doing something else. Most of them have no inkling about the industry, let alone the state of the job market - whether it was yesterday, today or tomorrow.\n\nWith that rant out of the way...\n\n**Why does anyone (actually) a become civil engineer?**\n\nThere is no one persona which describes the ideal civil engineer. There are many reasons why people choose civil engineering\n\n*Reason 1 : Many people choose civil engineering because they can get a government job (for the work-life balance, job security, and extra money)*.\n\nIf they don't choose it, then their parent make them study civil engineering because for the pre-liberalization era parents, a government job is essentially a once in a lifetime lottery. If you win that lottery, it makes life easier for your parents - (i) extra social status, (ii) higher (in case of groom) or lower (in case of bride) dowry requirements can be set without much debate, and (iii) finally an end to education-related expenditure (no further spending is required on professional courses or further coaching for government jobs)\n\nThere are many government departments, PSUs, and ministries which hire civil engineers. Starting from the public works department of your state to Indian Railways and ISRO & even RBI and SEBI at the central government level.\n\nFor state government vacancies the posts are filled through respective state public service commissions & for central government vacancies - (i) PSUs hire through GATE or a separate exam of their own, (ii) departments & ministries hire through UPSC Engineering Services Examination for officer level posts & specific selection boards (SSB & RRB) for lower level posts\n\nCivil engineering always had, has & will have the highest number of vacancies in government institutions as compared to other engineering branches. This is why civil engineering as a career option is popular among pre-1991 parents. As long as the government continues to hire civil engineers, many parents will force their kids to study civil engineering. End of Story.\n\nIn case you are wondering why governments hire so many civil engineers, its because for every road, bridge, canal, dam, sewer, boundary wall, building, stadium that gets built in this country, the government funds almost all of it out of its own pockets, and government my friend, has very deep pockets (Google debt of NHAI if you have time to kill)\n\n*Reason 2 : Many people also join civil engineering, because they have no clue what to do with life and gave more importance to being at a particular institution than to their choice of branch*\n\nThis includes people who are attracted to places of opportunity. For many getting into IIT\/NIT\/BITS was more important than actually becoming an engineer, because IIT\/NIT\/BITS are cool. And like many rats before them, the race was all that mattered to them.\n\nFor example, some of them join an IIT just for the sake of the IIT tag and then hope that by the end of their first year, they will successfully score a near perfect GPA and switch branches to their preferred one despite stiff competition. Most of them end up being stuck in the civil engineering department, because college after all is meant for enjoying & not giving a damn about GPAs.\n\nThese enlightened souls then either get interested in \"start-ups\" or become part of the \"coding culture\" or in general get disenchanted with engineering and decide to \"Get an MBA\". There is nothing wrong with all these things, except that these special souls now become crusaders whose job is to cull any leftover demand & interest for civil engineering among schoolkids.\n\nSo, ultimately this lot either - (i) ends up starting a small business and call it a \"start-up\", (ii) head towards whichever B-school will take them, (iii) get hired by any IT mass-recruiters who like them don't care about their branch, or (iv) actually ends up excelling in their passion - some become successful entrepreneurs at the helm of unicorns, or actors (Jeetu Bhaiyya !!!), or pilots (Flying Bull Beast whatever), or software engineers in FAANG and other acronyms I haven't bothered to look up. The final category is a tiny minority compared to the rest 3, but everybody likes to cite category 4 to tell you civil engineering sucks.\n\nThe logic goes something like this -\n\n1. Software\/Finance pays more\n2. I can't make it into these jobs\n3. Hence, I made the wrong choice - Every other branch other than CSE sucks and is s\\*\\*\\*\\^\n\n\\^This mentality is why we ended up with private universities that have 3000+ seats in CSE in a single batch\n\n*Reason 3 : A tiny minority joins this branch because it actually loves the branch*\n\nI personally love construction, I grew up around civil engineers from 4 different continents. Civil engineering was that truly global career where if you so desired could work in places like US, UK or Netherlands or any other developed country or work in rugged places like Uganda, Somalia, Chile, Azerbaijan, or Egypt or any other developing country (even Pakistan!!!).\n\nAnd all these countries have governments with deep pockets. If their pockets aren't deep enough, the World Bank (or ADB, JICA for that matter) will happily lend you money. With that money you build infrastructure. Or at least pretend that you are building infrastructure.\n\nI hated thermodynamics, so I chose civil engineering over mechanical engineering. Plus, growing up I saw more roads & bridges being built in my state than factories & heavy industrial plants. So the economy of my state & personal circumstances primarily guided my career choice.\n\nFew even go on get PhDs and join academia or work in research labs on obscure topics like intelligent transportation systems, urban economics, spatial econometrics, applying AI\/ML to complex problems, making all sorts of concrete that can be used  - underground, underwater, on the Moon & what not.\n\n**Shut Up & Tell Me Where Are The Jobs**\n\n*The Big Daddy : Real Estate Sector*\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century all the good paying jobs were in the real estate sector. These were the days of the boom in markets like Mumbai, Gurugram and Bengaluru. Heck, the real estate sector actually got so flush with cash that they even started giving a damn about construction deadlines and started hiring construction project managers to ensure homes & offices were delivered on schedule. Home prices were high, but still affordable, you could buy a 2bhk home worth 4 times your annual income, because such properties were available.\n\nThis boom period ended after the Great Crash of 2008 when capital fled real estate markets and only people who weren't capable of speculating in more sophisticated manners remained invested in the real estate market. The real estate sector isn't willing to cut prices today, and speculators obviously are in no hurry to sell assets because a property can be kept locked for a century, or even more - it is not exactly perishable like a banana, rather its steel and concrete moulded to last a lifetime.\n\nThe real estate sector is the primary job provider to civil engineering graduates. So the health of the real estate sector in a particular state is reflected in the placement statistics of colleges in & around that state. Sadly, the real estate sector is in the toilet for almost a decade now. Currently realtors aren't launching new projects with the same frequency as the boom period because they are already sitting with a huge stock of unsold inventory. \n\nMost new launches have been in the luxury bracket and in the commercial (offices) & retail (malls) space. And for such large scale projects, you don't need as many civil engineers as you did before. \n\nThese firms offer 4-7LPA for graduates and 6-10LPA to people with PG degrees in construction management. But overall the job market isn't as hot as it used to be. This is also because engineering colleges and institutions like NICMAR increased intake obscenely - leading to an oversupply & simultaneous decrease in quality of intake (anyone who sits for the exam these days is offered an admission)\n\n*The Actual Industry - Relevant Now More Than Ever*\n\nThe services sector has had a steady demand for civil engineers, but they now require a master's degree for most entry level roles - although in the early 2000s this wasn't the case. These firms offer 5-9LPA to people with masters degrees in any one of the many specializations of civil engineering. They hire design engineers who design bridges, roadways, highways, water treatment plants, dams, canals, etc. for clients (read, governments) across the world. \n\nThese firms have even started developing bespoke software to cater to the needs of the clients, since the traditional software services firms have never bothered to enter such specialized markets. So civil engineering graduates who can code are also in demand.\n\nThe good thing about these firms is that they don't discriminate between institutions because they know all folks in India are equally unskilled. So, they hire for the same role you will find folks from some random college in Bengaluru to folks from IIT Roorkee or Kanpur or Bombay (considered the best for this branch). Heck, some senior engineers even have PhDs. \n\nSo, in the current market if you want a job in civil engineering you better specialize further and get a masters degree and enter any of the design firms that operate in India - And almost 6 out of Top 15 design firms in the world have offices in multiple locations in India.\n\n**If Its So Good Why Are Many Unemployed & Why Is The Pay Low**\n\nWell, here's the bad news first - Pay will always be low. It will certainly be lower than software\/IT\/banking etc. The average senior software engineer probably earns 1.5x-6x of an average senior civil engineer.\n\nNow for the good news - Pay may maybe low, but this is a sector where experience is respected. The first thing to go on a job description for a civil engineering role is the mandatory minimum years of experience required. So, this is a profession where a senior civil engineer can be as old as 75!!! And until these old farts retire or drop dead, there wont be much growth for the people at the lower ends of the pyramid.\n\nThis is both good and bad. Its bad for the fresher who is looking for a job, but it very good for experienced civil engineers. They know that they cant be replaced by 2-3 young idiots with barely any experience. And that's where this branch is different from others. There aren't many senior software engineers who are in their 50s or 60s, but there are many such senior civil engineers. Civil engineering doesn't suffer from inherent ageism like the software sector does. Nobody forces you to get into management or get out.\n\nThen there's the ultimate truth bomb - You wont get rich working for a civil engineering firm. You will get rich by starting your own civil engineering firm. And I get it, most of us don't want to go through the headache of running a business in India for earning a \"measly & piddly\" income of 20-50LPA. You would rather work for a business which pays you that income annually - nicely \"packaged\" of course. But that is no reason to defame a branch which has done no harm to you & a branch which you don't care about.\n\nCivil engineers whom I know are small business owners with their own consultancies earn as high as 20-50LPA. That band is so wide, because this depends on which market are you operating in. Are you in the business of catering to realtors in Mumbai or Gurugram? Or are you in the business of providing design services to road & bridge projects in a rich state like Karnataka? Or are you a contractor who is involved in construction of projects funded by GoI? A lot depends on the business you are in and the market that you are operating in.\n\nCivil engineers who work for consultancies wont earn much because there is an upper limit to how many projects they can work on simultaneously. To earn more money you need scale, which you wont have until you start your own firm. The firm has no incentive to pay you a bulk of its margin when it knows that - (i) profit margins on government projects are razor thin and a significant chunk of it is lost in bribes & kickbacks to government officials and politicians, (ii) it can replace senior engineers with retired government engineers who often are cheaper substitutes for senior civil engineers, but are in short supply & (iii) it can fire pesky junior engineers in the firm at a whim because there is no dearth in supply of freshers who can be trained to suit their needs\n\n**My Problem With Most Civil Engineering Graduates**\n\nSorry for restarting the rant.\n\nMost civil engineering graduates end up wasting 4 years. If they end up in a good MTech program - they further ruin those 2 years by preparing for government exams instead of developing actual skills which are needed by the industry. Then they blame the branch. What makes matters worse is that students are responsible for place-com performance, with very little, but very often, no support from profs.\n\nAnd when you have batch full of \"govt job aspirants\", the placement of the entire batch suffers. Even the good ones who have the requisite skills end up jobless. These \"aspirants\" instead of gaining skills end up giving as high as 6-7 attempts in a bid to score a government job. The problem is exacerbated by seniors who advise only to prepare for ESE\/PSUs as the way to a job - which is the worst way to hunt for a job. Preparing for XYZ exam is not a career plan. It makes much more sense to have job in hand and then prepare simultaneously for government jobs - given the high competition and soaring costs of coaching - exacerbated by the multiple attempts one ends up giving.\n\nThe blame doesn't lie entirely on the students or their parents. Most of them are ignorant idiots who just want a government job or enroll in an engineering course because that's what the herd is doing. Not every parent or student has access to information on skills and job prospects of each and every branch. So lets stop blaming the victims.\n\nIdeally, its the job of a professional body to ensure that only those young engineers who have the necessary skills & competencies get to practice as a professional engineer (like CAs, for example). for example - In the US, you need to write the Fundamentals of Engineering exam (similar to GATE) to become an \"Engineer-in-Training\" (EIT) in civil engineering firms.\n\nBut the professional bodies for civil engineering in India are mostly run by government engineers who scratch each others' backs and keep giving each other stupid awards. Just compare the websites of ASCE\/ICE and Institution of Engineers, India.\n\nSuch abdication of responsibility towards young engineers by the senior engineers is very disheartening. Ideally, only competent civil engineers should be able to practice. The ones who don't make the cut or those who engage in malpractices should be shown the door. There are no formal mechanisms in India for all of this.\n\nWhich is why, in my personal opinion, the civil engineering profession has ended up with so little public trust.\n\n**Okay, But What Should I Do? (For currently in their BTech)**\n\nIdeally you should have chosen a branch that you are interested in - for civil engineering you need to be good at math (we don't use vector calculus a lot) & classical mechanics\n\n*Focus on skills -* Go look at job postings of good firms on LinkedIn and see what skills are in demand - and then go acquire them. Learning random software and having a bouquet or word soup of stuff on your resume is not the same as upskilling - learn only those software relevant to a particular job role. People write AutoCAD and MS Excel in their resumes - I would like to tell you that it is considered a joke - at least in MNCs - because this is the 21st century and who the hell doesn't know how to use MS Excel or AutoCAD ?!?! (I taught my 9 year old cousin AutoCAD btw - he loves it - he thinks it is the MS Paint for grown-ups)\n\n*Focus on networking -* the job market isn't a frozen beast, you need to be in touch with alumni and folks who work in the industry so that you can figure which way the job market is moving - there is no point in becoming a structural engineer if - (i) the real state sector is in the toilet & (ii) there is an oversupply of folks with a master's degree in structural engineering\n\n*Don't rely on \"placements\" -* The civil engineering profession has traditionally relied on young graduates joining firms as apprentices and then moving up the ladder. Unfortunately in India, this system is by and large, non-existent. The placement culture that we see in the software & financial sectors is also absent in this branch except for a few global design firms. So intern at firms in all summer breaks. Nobody owes you a job. Placement culture is only a recent phenomenon & frankly without mass recruiters there would have been no such \"culture\". And civil engineering firms aren't mass recruiters.\n\n**PS (my\\_qualifications) - BTech + ME in civil engineering -** I work at a global design firm and design highways (3 continents so far)\n\n**PS2 -** Sorry for the lengthy post - I hate people who s\\*\\*\\* on my branch without facts or evidence - *Senti ho jata hu thoda, bas*",

        "body": "I feel it's worth posting the full letter this quote comes from (as long as it is!) Thompson wrote this to a friend who asked him for advice in 1958. What I find amazing is Thompson was only 22 when he wrote this! Long before any of his major works he had this level of insight to life. I think of how clueless and lost I was at 22, and I wish I could've read this back then, yet it still had an effect on me reading it in my late 20s to change my own life.\n\nDear Hume,\r  \n\r  \nYou ask advice: ah, what a very human and very dangerous thing to do! For to give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal\u2014 to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.\r  \n\r  \nI am not a fool, but I respect your sincerity in asking my advice. I ask you though, in listening to what I say, to remember that all advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. What is truth to one may be disaster to another. I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cTo be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether \u2019tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles \u2026 \u201d (Shakespeare)\r  \n\r  \nAnd indeed, that IS the question: whether to float with the tide, or to swim for a goal. It is a choice we must all make consciously or unconsciously at one time in our lives. So few people understand this! Think of any decision you\u2019ve ever made which had a bearing on your future: I may be wrong, but I don\u2019t see how it could have been anything but a choice however indirect\u2014 between the two things I\u2019ve mentioned: the floating or the swimming.\r  \n\r  \nBut why not float if you have no goal? That is another question. It is unquestionably better to enjoy the floating than to swim in uncertainty. So how does a man find a goal? Not a castle in the stars, but a real and tangible thing. How can a man be sure he\u2019s not after the \u201cbig rock candy mountain,\u201d the enticing sugar-candy goal that has little taste and no substance?\r  \n\r  \nThe answer\u2014 and, in a sense, the tragedy of life\u2014 is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It\u2019s not the fireman who has changed, but you. Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.\r  \n\r  \nSo it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?\r  \n\r  \nThe answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on \u201cthe meaning of man\u201d and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject. (I use the term \u201cgod only knows\u201d purely as an expression.) There\u2019s very little sense in my trying to give it up to you in the proverbial nutshell, because I\u2019m the first to admit my absolute lack of qualifications for reducing the meaning of life to one or two paragraphs.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m going to steer clear of the word \u201cexistentialism,\u201d but you might keep it in mind as a key of sorts. You might also try something called Being and Nothingness by Jean-Paul Sartre, and another little thing called Existentialism: From Dostoyevsky to Sartre. These are merely suggestions. If you\u2019re genuinely satisfied with what you are and what you\u2019re doing, then give those books a wide berth. (Let sleeping dogs lie.) But back to the answer. As I said, to put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES.\r  \n\r  \nBut don\u2019t misunderstand me. I don\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors\u2014 but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires\u2014 including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.\r  \n\r  \nAs I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal), he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).\r  \n\r  \nIn short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life\u2014 the definitive act of will which makes a man an individual.\r  \n\r  \nLet\u2019s assume that you think you have a choice of eight paths to follow (all pre-defined paths, of course). And let\u2019s assume that you can\u2019t see any real purpose in any of the eight. THEN\u2014 and here is the essence of all I\u2019ve said\u2014 you MUST FIND A NINTH PATH.\r  \n\r  \nNaturally, it isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. You\u2019ve lived a relatively narrow life, a vertical rather than a horizontal existence. So it isn\u2019t any too difficult to understand why you seem to feel the way you do. But a man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance.\r  \n\r  \nSo if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as they are, or to seriously seek something else. But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life. But you say, \u201cI don\u2019t know where to look; I don\u2019t know what to look for.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd there\u2019s the crux. Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don\u2019t know\u2014 is it? Who can make that decision but you? But even by DECIDING TO LOOK, you go a long way toward making the choice.\r  \n\r  \nIf I don\u2019t call this to a halt, I\u2019m going to find myself writing a book. I hope it\u2019s not as confusing as it looks at first glance. Keep in mind, of course, that this is MY WAY of looking at things. I happen to think that it\u2019s pretty generally applicable, but you may not. Each of us has to create our own credo\u2014 this merely happens to be mine.\r  \n\r  \nIf any part of it doesn\u2019t seem to make sense, by all means call it to my attention. I\u2019m not trying to send you out \u201con the road\u201d in search of Valhalla, but merely pointing out that it is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that\u2014 no one HAS to do something he doesn\u2019t want to do for the rest of his life. But then again, if that\u2019s what you wind up doing, by all means convince yourself that you HAD to do it. You\u2019ll have lots of company.\r  \n\r  \nAnd that\u2019s it for now. Until I hear from you again, I remain,\r  \n\r  \nyour friend,\r  \nHunter",

Originally, I was just keeping notes in a Google Doc, but figured I could create something more permanent and aesthetic.\n\nIt covers topics (some more in-depth than others), such as:\n\n* Distributions\n* Linear and Logistic Regression\n* Decision Trees and Random Forest\n* SVM\n* KNN\n* Clustering\n* Boosting\n* Dimension Reduction (PCA, LDA, Factor Analysis)\n* NLP\n* Neural Networks\n* Recommender Systems\n* Reinforcement Learning\n* Anomaly Detection\n\nThe four-page Data Science Cheatsheet can be found [here](https:\/\/github.com\/aaronwangy\/Data-Science-Cheatsheet\/blob\/main\/Data_Science_Cheatsheet.pdf), and I hope it's helpful to those looking to review or brush up on machine learning concepts. Feel free to leave any suggestions and star\/save the PDF for reference.\n\nCheers!\n\nGithub Repo: [https:\/\/github.com\/aaronwangy\/Data-Science-Cheatsheet](https:\/\/github.com\/aaronwangy\/Data-Science-Cheatsheet)\n\nEdit - Thanks for the awards!

There should be no relationship with each other if there is physical violence which even includes one slap.\n\nMy grandmom told me a few years ago that when my parents were newly weds they had come to visit my grandparents, so one day my dad slapped my mom so hard that her nose started bleeding. I told my grandmom that why din't she say anything to him, she was like 'Damaad hai aur yeh toh Mia Biwi ka mamla hai toh hum kya bole isme\" \n\nI said she is your daughter and you are her mother and no one had the right to slap her. \n\nMy parents are now separated for good, she was in an abusive relationship, I always hated my dad and still hate him, I do understand my mom can be difficult sometimes but that doesn't means anyone has a right to hit her or treat her like shit, I have always stood up for my mom, once my dad punched my mom and broke her ribs. I punched and kicked my dad, I was 15 back then, It was a warning to him and after that he never lay a finger on my mom.\n\nMy dad's family and even my mom's family went crazy on me that how could I hit my dad and the usual nonsense of how he is older than me and I have no shame. I said to all of them that I don't care how old are you but even if you touch my mother then I will break your face. \n\nAfter a few years of my parents separation, my dad wanted to reconcile and he came to talk to my grandparents, my grandmom\/Naani wanted them together, but I said NO and Divorce is the only solution and it was again everybody against me. But I am happy that day my mom din't listen to my Naani and Dad. \n\nMy Naani still hates me and my mom, I don't know what to say about her she is sick in the head, she treats my mom like shit now, my mom does all her work, but my mom keeps on taking her shit, I always stand up for my mom but then my mom goes crazy on me that she is my Naani. \n\nThis mentality needs to change that Beta and Pati are Bhagwan and if you are a daughter or a daughter in law then you are a naukrani. I am a guy myself, usually kids who go through this kind of shit in their family they become like them, but I am the opposite, I did not become like them and I saw that they are wrong and I cannot be wrong and I have to do the right thing and stand up for the right things.",

You literally can never tell with some people (because these people can be constantly warm and happy-go-lucky. You can have an SO that's always attentive, friendly and inclusive, without realising that they've lost their original feelings for you and are hoping to find someone else). I learned that at 19 when I wound up dating a person who was basically the human version of  Mr. Peanutbutter. It turned out that although he was very close with me, and in friendly terms with my room mate (and he also hung out constantly with the friends we shared), none of us realised that he had been cheating on me for 6 months into our relationship.  \n\nSo, now that I'm with my SO for 8 years--I decided early on not to look for the signs. Keep your finances to yourself (while paying your part of the rent\/bills), be supportive and kind--but don't try to play detective because the signs are always different and at times...very hard to find. The way I see it--if the person's cheating on you? Best to not dwell on it and just walk away. There's usually no other good way to handle infidelity.",

        "body": "# Edit\n\nI see people are still finding this comment. As much as I value the feedback, I think this roadmap is a bit outdated by now as I've grown as a Data Scientist\/Machine Learning Engineer myself over the last two years. A while back I started a YouTube channel where I have already uploaded 7h of in-depth lecture material. My next video will be a revised version of this roadmap. So subscribe if you want to be updated: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCg5yxN5N4Yup9dP\\_uN69vEQ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCg5yxN5N4Yup9dP_uN69vEQ)\n\n# Introduction\n\nI think there are three basic areas that should be covered if you want to be a competent ML engineer: mathematics, concrete ML knowledge and programming skills. These are rough categories and I don't want to give the impression that this is all there is to it, but I notice the biggest progress in myself when I practice all three areas regularly over a longer period of time. I recommend that anyone who wants to learn ML professionally should take all three areas equally seriously and to study them simultaneously if possible.\n\n# Mathematics\n\nNot all areas of mathematics are relevant to ML. The ones that are most important to ML are Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and Multivariable Calculus, for which there are a lot of good online courses. Some of them I've listed below.\n\nWe need linear algebra because the data we deal with in ML contexts are stored in n-dimensional arrays. An understanding of the interplay between scalars, vectors, matrices and tensors is therefore essential for everything we hope to do with our data. Linear Algebra will be the language we will be speaking when doing ML of any kind.\n\nWe often need probability theory to explain *why* a particular learning algorithm works, where certain cost functions come from, and so on. Often it is about maximizing probabilities, which cannot be understood without an understanding of basic stochastic concepts.\n\nEverywhere in the ML context we encounter multidimensional functions and the confident handling of them is necessary to understand *how* our algorithms work. If there are no closed form solutions for the optimal parameters of a learning algorithm, for example, iterative methods are often used to learn the parameters. In this case, the gradient of a cost function is often used, which is obtained from the partial derivatives of a multidimensional function.\n\nFor general intuition, I think 3Blue1Brown is the best place to start:\n\nLinear Algebra: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fNk\\_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE\\_ab](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)\n\nCalculus: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)\n\nAfter you've got the intuition and refreshed the basics of high school mathematics, I can recommend the following more in-depth courses:\n\nProbability Theory: [https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science\/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013\/](https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science\/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013\/) This is HANDS-DOWN the best course I've ever taken. I found the content very difficult, probably due to my non-mathematical background, but I still have the feeling that I came out of the course with a deep understanding of probability theory. Some of the content you will probably hardly see again in ML contexts, but the basic concepts like counting, conditional probabilities, random variables, distribution functions, MLE and MAP, Bayesian Inference, etc. are extremely well explained.\n\nLinear Algebra: [https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/mathematics\/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011\/](https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/mathematics\/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011\/) Gilbert Strang is just a gangster in Linear Algebra. I love his lecture style and he manages to make linear algebra super tangible.\n\nCalculus I-III: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/amarchese22\/playlists?disable\\_polymer=1](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/amarchese22\/playlists?disable_polymer=1) I just got this playlist recommended two days ago, but the many visualizations and digestible video lengths seem to be good conditions for a good information transfer. I suggest to at least check out Calculus I and II.\n\nMultivariable Calculus: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC5feHa6Rc5c0wbRTx56nF7](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC5feHa6Rc5c0wbRTx56nF7) Here is again 3Blue1Brown with his amazing video series on multivariable Calculus. I think this playlist has exactly the right depth, not too trivial, but also not unnecessarily packed with abstract proofs. There are certainly more complex and deeper courses for multivariable Calculus, but for prospective ML Engineers this is more than appropriate.\n\nMatrix Methods: [https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/mathematics\/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018\/](https:\/\/ocw.mit.edu\/courses\/mathematics\/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018\/) Another course by Gilbert Strang. There all three areas (linear algebra, probability theory, multivariable calculus) are combined with applications in ML.\n\nAfter these courses there should be little mathematics that will surprise you later.\n\n# Concrete ML Knowledge\n\nAndrew Ng has, in my opinion, taken the undisputed position of offering the world the Holy Trinity of basic ML education. Everything builds on each other and is more practice-oriented than it is theoretical. Although mathematical notation is used, everything is still comparatively basic.\n\nAndrew Ng's ML course: [https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/machine-learning](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/machine-learning) Even though the course may seem very demanding (I've needed three attempts) at first, you'll remember him forever as Prof Ng explains the basics of ML like hardly anyone else. However, the course shows its age because MATLAB is not a language that is up-to-date for ML. When working on the code assignments, you should therefore google for Python implementations and work on them instead.\n\nThe other two courses are the logical continuation of Andrew Ng's first ML course.\n\nAndrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization: [https:\/\/de.coursera.org\/specializations\/deep-learning](https:\/\/de.coursera.org\/specializations\/deep-learning)\n\nAndrew Ng's Tensorflow in Practice Specialization: [https:\/\/de.coursera.org\/specializations\/tensorflow-in-practice](https:\/\/de.coursera.org\/specializations\/tensorflow-in-practice)\n\nAfter that you are ready for advanced courses:\n\nOld but gold, the CS229 lectures of 2008: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E&list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599) This is Ng's coursera ML course on steroids. Have you wondered why logistic regression uses the sigmoid function? Here you will find the answer. Have you always wanted to know how to derive the Normal Equation? Here you will find the answer. The course is sometimes bashed on the fact that it is old, but the reality is that the concepts presented here also work in the age of neural networks and are sometimes even preferable. Classical models just do their job well, too.\n\nAnd a modern rendition: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PLa-Bt050gYuhEeLRG8YBmFxwLvTJ5FqPS](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PLa-Bt050gYuhEeLRG8YBmFxwLvTJ5FqPS) Any criticism of the above course is nullified, as there is a current version of it. The focus here is more on neural networks, but that's why the old CS229 course is not outclassed.\n\nI also like this set of online lectures: [http:\/\/www.cs.cornell.edu\/courses\/cs4780\/2018fa\/lectures\/](http:\/\/www.cs.cornell.edu\/courses\/cs4780\/2018fa\/lectures\/) Somehow I always come across these lectures while doing my own research. I think they are very good and the focus is rather probabilistic. The only catch, in my opinion, is that the lecturer's handwriting is very bad, which is why I always have the handout open in parallel. His accent is also funny.\n\n# Programming Skills\n\nHere I had to start from zero but I learned a lot in my complementary computer science studies, so I can't recommend as many resources as in the other sections. But when studying Python, I refered to Corey Schafer a lot, who has many wonderful Python tutorials on Youtube: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/schafer5\/playlists](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/schafer5\/playlists)\n\nThere are also two books that I can recommend for learning Python, especially for ML and Data Science applications:\n\n[https:\/\/jakevdp.github.io\/PythonDataScienceHandbook\/](https:\/\/jakevdp.github.io\/PythonDataScienceHandbook\/) It contains all important information about the packages NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib, which are all used again and again when you want to program ML algorithms or prepare and visualize the necessary data.\n\n[https:\/\/github.com\/ageron\/handson-ml](https:\/\/github.com\/ageron\/handson-ml) Please buy the paperback, the author deserves it. This book is the best application-oriented resource I know. I often find myself referring to this book.\n\nAlways try to implement the knowledge directly, i.e. to reprogram algorithms in Python. If that's too hard, google the code and try to understand it, we all do. Get familiar with the Scikit-Learn library and Tensorflow and try to complete small projects that you can upload to Github. You won't get any better without practice. Learn app and web development to embed your projects into applications that are actually profitable for users.",

I have a good grasp of Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn etc so I decided to make the jump to this course.\n\nIt is HEAVY math and math is not my strong suit. In fact I have a pretty basic understanding of math sadly because of failures when I was younger. \n\nI am lost, I want to put a lot of effort into this course but I am worried it is quite far above my head. What can I do to better understand this content? Do I need to know these heavy math functions to get through the coding exercises?",

The author reviews six common team models:\n\n> __The Center-of-Excellence Model__\n\n> Let\u2019s start with the most centralized of all models. In the center-of-excellence (CoE) model, also known as the research model, the expectation is that the data science team would work independently to identify big bets and build prototypes. Under this model, the data science team is considered to be the company\u2019s innovation arm.\n\n> __The Accounting Model__\n\n> In the accounting model, also known as the BI model, the data science team would produce reports and presentations on a recurring basis (usually monthly and quarterly). The data science team would inform the organization of notable movements in top-level metrics. Once the team identifies an interesting trend, they would work with product teams to investigate the root cause. Thus, quite frequently, playing detective becomes a main part of the data science team under the accounting model.\n\n> __The Consultant Model__\n\n> In the consultant model, the data science team is assigned tickets or emailed with questions. Data science managers then prioritize the tickets and questions and assign them to data scientists.\n\n> __The Embedded Model__\n\n> In this model, product teams hire their own data scientists. Each engineering manager is in charge of planning for data scientist headcount, hiring, and allocation. The data scientist within each product team has the engineering team members as their peers.\n\n> __The Democratic Model__\n\n> In this model, it is believed that easy and straightforward access to data by product managers, designers, engineering managers, and engineers would lessen or remove the need for a data science role. Many identify the main need for hiring data scientists to be the lack of proper infrastructure for fast and easy dashboard creation.\n\n> __The Product Data Science Model__\n\n> Between the extremes of the fully centralized model (the CoE model) and the fully decentralized model (the embedded model), there exists a spectrum of hybrid models that take certain characteristics from each of the aforementioned models. Taking advantage of the strengths of both models, while actively making up for their deficiencies is what makes hybrid models successful.\n\n> The product data science (PDS) model is inspired, in part, by the matrix structure. In this model, individuals are simultaneously part of the data science function and the product. Data scientists, each a member of a product team, report into a central data science team.\n\nWhat models have you worked under? What was your experience? Which do you prefer?\n\nedit: copied blurbs from the article into the text post",

He was working a manual labor job though I can't remember exactly what. He had 5 kids and also looked after his 2 eldest nephews. They were approximately 7 or 8 and his kids were only a little older. He often wouldn't get home until 9 or 10 at night after working ridiculously long hours.\n\nHe came home especially late one night and sat down at the dinner table by himself. He looked down and noticed that the floor was very dirty in his house. My grandfather walked in at this point and found his dad sweeping and he asked why he was doing so, given the time. \n\nMy great grandfather said \"the floor needed to be swept, so here I am\"\n\nIt wasn't until years later that the story got shared for what it was, and in essence my great grandfather was trying to teach my grandfather that there's no sense in getting upset when someone else hasn't done something that you are capable of doing.\n\nWe all have to do things we don't want to, but if we are capable, then we would be happy we can do it.\n\nBe patient, people of Reddit, and sweep you floors.",

        "body": "I've noticed several posts lately that concern men who are desensitized, cum too quickly during sex, or have trouble getting or maintaining erections. I believe that for those posters, their problems may stem from improper masturbation. As someone who used to have these problems, I thought I'd weigh in and write a guide that I can share instead of writing the same comment over and over.\n\nIn this guide I will lay out some rules for masturbating, the details of how to follow those rules, and finally the theory behind why the rules matter. I imposed these rules on myself and I experienced the following benefits:\n\n* **Increased ability to get an erection with a partner**\n* **Increased staying power**\n* **Better orgasms**\n* **Better feeling during PIV**\n\nThese benefits form a positive feedback loop. Once you start seeing benefits, your confidence will grow and you will only see increased benefit.\n\nA few things to clear up first:\n\n* This guide is aimed at penis-havers who want to improve their sexual performance\n  * A lot of this guide also applies to women, but since I think these problems tend to affect men more often, I have aimed the guide at them.\n* This guide discusses sexual dysfunction, but it is aimed at men who can achieve full erection and orgasm naturally (\"all the pipes work\")\n* This guide is what worked for me, and is totally my opinion. I don't claim for it to be *correct* or *the only way to do it*\n* I'm not against pornography, but have reservations about its overuse\n* If you don't follow this guide and still have a great sex life, that's great! I'm happy to hear it\n\n\nThe Rules\n======\n\n1. **Use lube always.**\n2. **Never masturbate for less than 10 minutes at a time.**\n3. **Only masturbate when you are already horny.**\n4. **Treat porn as a luxury, not a necessity.**\n\nThe Details\n==========\n\n1.  **Use lube always:** \n\n  You should never masturbate without lubrication. You can start dry but once you're erect it's time to get wet. I recommend coconut oil, or whatever other lubricant you would use when having sex. Be generous with it - really grease that pole.\n\n2. **Never masturbate for less than 10 minutes at a time:**\n\n  Make it a marathon, not a sprint. If you can't make it to 10 minutes of full stimulation without cumming, then you need to **ease the fuck off** and edge yourself or stop completely until you are calm enough to continue without cumming. Change your grip, use a light touch, ease off the porn, do whatever you have to do to get to 10 minutes. After that you can cum whenever you like.\n\n3. **Only masturbate when you are already horny:**\n\n  You should never masturbate just because you're bored. Watching porn to get horny first does not count.\n\n4. **Treat porn as a luxury, not a necessity:**\n  just because you *have* porn doesn't mean you *need* it. Occasionally practice masturbating just with your imagination. If you find it impossible to become erect or achieve orgasm without pornography, you might want to check out ~~r\/NoFap~~ (EDIT: r\/PornFree).\n\nThe Theory\n=======\n\nThe driving principle behind these rules is this:\n**treat masturbation like training for sex**\n\n1.  **Use lube always:** \n\n  This one is simple. Good sex is wet. Dry sex is not good sex. \n\n  When you use lube, you are mimicking the kinds of sensations you can expect during sex. You will find that it feels better than going dry, and is all around more natural.\n\n  When you jerk off dry, you are training your brain to respond to dry stimulation. This causes desensitization because it is very rough compared to a vagina. **This makes sex less enjoyable** because you are used to harder stimulation.\n\n  Paradoxically, jerking off dry also makes you **cum sooner during sex**. Your body isn't used to the wetness, and this puts your mojo off balance, making you last shorter.\n\n\n2. **Never masturbate for less than 10 minutes at a time:**\n\n  Many men masturbate like a firework - they shoot up and up and up and explode a minute later. Then, when they are having sex, they do the same thing! You might call it \"rubbing one out\", but I call it **premature ejaculation**. You can't expect to last long during sex if you are racing to the finish line every time you jerk off!\n\n  You need to train your body to treat all sexual activities like a marathon, not a sprint. Just like a marathon, this will be **difficult** for beginners. It is hard to maintain the stamina and self control needed to hit that 10 minute mark. Just like a marathon, you **do not need to go full force the whole time!** You can take breaks, go slowly, even remove stimulus entirely. All that matters here is that you are staying aroused for the full time. As you gain confidence and awareness of when you are about to cum, you can ratchet up the intensity until you eventually hit a full 10 minutes of stroking.\n\n  Another thing to mention is that **masturbating longer makes masturbating better!** You will cum harder and with more volume the longer you stay aroused.\n\n  Once your body is accustomed to being horny for longer periods of time, you will have more confidence during foreplay and intercourse, and more staying power. Your partner will also thank you for sticking around!\n\n3. **Only masturbate when you are already horny:**\n\n  This rule is all about equating pleasure with horniness and nothing else. If you masturbate just because you are bored, you are hitting your brain's pleasure centers with nothing but the act itself to focus on. You are mindlessly pursuing pleasure. **This makes sex less special.**\n\n  You want sex to be special because you want to get the most out of it. Think about the object of your desire. Maybe it's that cute girl with heart-shaped ass who lives in your building. Maybe it's the nice perky tits on the last woman you had sex with it. You want the object of your desire to be something real and worth working for. If you cheapen it by hitting the orgasm button when you aren't even horny, then your body won't try especially hard when you do get the chance.\n\n4. **Treat porn as a luxury, not a necessity:**\n\n  Porn is the worst best thing to happen to sex. If you're already horny from fantasizing, then actually seeing something in a picture or video can make you go wild. However, porn is a mood-altering drug, and it can become addictive. It can become a crutch. If you become reliant on porn, you are in for a **rude awakening** when you have sex.\n\n  Porn-Induced Erectile Dysfunction (PIED) is a real thing, and it *SUCKS*. Imagine one night you're jerking off and you're hard as a rock. Then, the next night, you finally bring home that girl with the ass from (3) and *you can't get hard with her*. WTF?! You know all the plumbing works, and her ass is so hot you can fry an egg on it! What's wrong? \n\n  Sex is more of a mental thing than many guys give it credit for. Your dick might be a 7 inch cum cannon but your brain is the one that has to load it. So, when we use porn every single time we masturbate, we are training our brains to become aroused with this **great big visual stimulus** right in front of us. It becomes a crutch.\n\n  That's not to say that you should swear off porn. Porn is not in and of itself unhealthy. It's how you use it. Think of it like alcohol. It's great and healthy to get drunk occasionally and have a great time! However, if you are doing it all the time, and find that you can't have fun without drinking, then you have a problem. It's all about moderation.\n\n  How do you know if it's a problem? Just try to masturbate with no porn. If you can get all the way erect and cum without any porn, just your imagination, then you are healthy! If not, you should consider why you can't do it and whether you think it's a problem.\n\n  If you do find yourself reliant on pornography, I highly recommend ~~r\/NoFap~~ (EDIT: r\/PornFree). They are a supportive community with lots of information on how to deal with this problem.\n\n\nConclusion\n=======\n\nI just want everyone to have the best sex lives they possibly can. I think that starts with correct practice when you are alone. Masturbating is the best way to get fully in tune with your body and learn your limits, but if you do it incorrectly you can end up adversely affecting your sex life.\n\nFollowing the rules and theory I have laid out here should increase your confidence and stamina, which drives a positive feedback loop that leads to sexual performance!\n\nThere it is, that's my guide! I hope you found this collection of my personal insights to be helpful with whatever problems you may or may not have. I welcome any comments and criticism, and of course, would love to see this shared. Just remember that this is all my opinion, and I don't claim that it is the right way or the only way.\n\nThanks for reading and Happy Fucking!\n\nEdit\n===\nThis post has attracted a lot of attention and several good points were brought up in the comments. I will address them here since there are too many to address every single comment.\n\nAssumptions\n----\n\nI originally didn't realize I was making several assumptions. Let me address them here:\n\n* **I assumed a circumcised penis:** I was circumcised as a child so I have very little context for how it feels to masturbate or have sex as an uncut man. From the comments, it seems that the foreskin provides natural lubrication, probably enough for our purposes here. Whether you use lube on the outside is up to you, though I do say it's worth a try.\n\n  For those you are uncut, please realize that some circumcised men do masturbate without lubrication, and it involves a lot of friction. I stand by my statement that circumcised men should definitely use lube. \n\n* **I assumed visual pornography:** When I used the term \"porn\", I meant pictures and videos. I don't have a lot of experience with erotica or audio erotica, so I can't make an informed opinion about them. I think the visual aspect of pornography is probably the most effective and possibly reliance-inducing aspect.\n\nConcessions\n--\n\nHere are some things that after reviewing the comments I realize might not make sense.\n\n* I said that rubbing dry can cause you to cum more quickly during sex. I think this is not a universal case, and its just my personal experience. Even my experience with it could be biased, so YMMV.\n\n* I gave a shoutout to r\/NoFap. I personally used their \"rebooting program\" and I found it helpful, though I didn't really dive into comment threads. Upon inspection, it appears that r\/PornFree is a more suitable community to go to for guidance about porn-specific problems.\n\nFAQ\n--\n\n* **Do I need to use lube? What kind should I use? It's so messy!**\n\n  The aim is to be *sliding* and not *tugging*. If you are circumcised, you should use lube. Period. As for what kind, there are lots of possibilities:\n\n  * Coconut oil - the same kind you cook with. I buy it in a jar, and that jar will last me several months. Coconut oil is also great for massage and lubrication during sex. It's really just great all around\n  * Soap \/ body wash - if you do it in the shower, that's fine by me! Just don't use straight water!\n  * OTC \/ sex shop lubes - these do exactly what they say on the tin. My GF and I like WET Platinum Strawberry\n  * Vaseline and lotion - never used them myself but probably fine \n  * This list is by no means exhaustive\n\n* **What do you mean by 'horny?'**\n\n  I mean you have an urge to fuck! You have something in mind that turns you on. This rule is mostly designed to keep you from cheapening the experience by masturbating out of boredom, or from doing it at a set time (like right before you sleep every night). If you *are* horny right before sleep, by all means go for it.\n\n* **If I am trying to simulate sex, shouldn't I be using a condom?**\n\n  That's not a bad idea. If you do use a condom, lubricate both sides of it. You don't have to use one every time.\n\n* **Is there a version for women?**\n\n  I'm not a woman, and my GF doesn't flick her own bean very often, so I don't see such a guide coming from me\n\n\nRedditor's Notes\n--\nWow this post blew up!

        "body": "Ok, this post will sound very cynical because I deal with it a lot (I'm an engineering manager who oversees both ML and production software). But I will give you a detailed answer as my intent is to be helpful! Keep in mind, I work for a large company. This probably does not apply to a startup that has limited ability\/capital to attract talent.\n\nFor a research scientist position, you have no shot unless you have a PhD and notable publications. (maybe if you have very notable publications and no PhD you could pull it off).\n\nFor a research engineer, we have interviewed people with non-standard backgrounds, so here you go!\n\nHere is what you should NOT do.\n\n- Don't brand yourself as a young kid who wants to \"work on cool problems\" as if we are going to pay you to not be bored and\/or learn cool stuff. No, we pay you because you generate 2x more value than your salary. You need to have a good reason for doing ML besides \"I don't want to build another CRUD app \/ etl pipeline \/ maintain big codebase.\" If you are truly knowledgeable about ML, you will come into the interview knowing that most of your effort will go into data cleaning and feature engineering, and a lot less time experimenting with different DNN architectures (for example).\n\n- Don't advertise you took the coursera course from Andrew Ng. Everyone has taken it, everyone advertises it. Even our Directors take the course just to learn new stuff. The DL cert should be old news for you.\n\n- Don't suggest ML as the first solution when we pose you a hypothetical problem. Many real word problems can be solved without ML and you need to be able to show you will pick the most practical solution and not just pick ML because you are a hammer and everything looks like a nail to you.\n\nSuggestions for standing out (you don't have to do all of these, but if you can knock at least two out of the park, you will probably get an interview from us)\n\n- You took the initiative at your current company to apply machine learning\n\n- You have built a website that demos some non-trivial A.I. project you built. This also shows you know how an engineering stack works end-to-end. You don't need to be a pro at building a full stack app, using libraries or frameworks that do most of the work is totally acceptable (and a good use of your time). The point is you can make it easy for us to see your model in action, and as a side effect, show you can code too.\n\n- You put a paper on Arxiv and\/or code on Github discussing how you did well on a Kaggle competition.\n\n- You have a blog documenting your learnings in the field. If there is a lot of useful copy-paste stuff on there, even if it is elementary, you are already creating value. :-)\n\n- Know how to host your models at scale. Knowledge of Apache Spark (or some sort of autoscaling on the cloud, the exact stack doesn't matter) or similar frameworks is a big plus. I have seen fantastic models not go into production because they don't scale. Knowledge about big data is another way to stand out.\n\n- You need to be a good software engineer. Your competition is software engineers who already work for me who I could train to pick up the same knowledge you have. If you are substantially worse at software engineering, you are a risky hire.\n\nI know that sounds like a lot of work, but try to see things from the employer's point of view. You either need to be a stand-out at ML (and make it extremely easy for us to tell) or pretty good but also have some other skills to bring to the table.\n\nAnd sincerely, good luck! Being a proactive self-teacher will benefit you in the long run (even if you don't see the fruit for the first few years).",

The fundamental questions of what data science is, and who a data scientist is, remain largely undecided. Regardless of where the answer will fall, there are a number of tools and techniques that every data scientist should have in their toolbelt. Although the software languages, frameworks, and algorithms will come in and out of fashion, the fundamentals behind the trade of data science, which we talk about in this session, have existed for centuries and will continue to be used for ages to come.\n\n**What will the audience learn from this talk?**  \nThe audience will learn an overview and history of the math, philosophy, software engineering, and algorithms that are inseparable from the field of Data Science. We will cover techniques like optimisation theory like principle component analysis, at the level of analysing where and why we use certain techniques, but not how they are implemented or how to use them in a data science pipeline.",

Strong internships (Dev or research anything works tbh) or some serious non copy paste work. You'll be amazed at the amount of people everywhere who claim to know about DL just because they have watched a Siraj Raval video or something. \n\nA simple screening question that I've asked to prospective teammates is to explain the time complexity of SGD, or say, their workflow in case they are facing heavy data imbalance. Our team usually follows that up by asking the candidate to implement\/try out a paper related to the problem that we are trying to solve. We definitely value strong experience with popular libraries like PyTorch\/TF and if you know Caffe, you are gold. You should be fairly comfortable with writing custom ops in CUDA.\nOne skill that I've seen in demand a lot is data maintenance. Most, if not all the teams hiring for DL positions already have stable architectures in place and model improvement is done through data improvement. There are teams in Microsoft IDC\/Research, Adobe Research, and Samsung Research which are looking to expand so you can try applying there. I've recently had interviews\/discussions with Spotify and Honda(Japan) and they too seem to be hiring people for data\/learning roles. Honda especially is trying to double down on their Autonomous transportation abilities and they have a very good facility set up in Tokyo. \nAnyways, knowledge is heavily complimented by luck. Interviewers have like an hour to gauge your knowledge in the field and so your selection depends heavily on you knowing what the interviewer knows too. Still, be fairly comfortable with at least one popular language, read up on some data versioning techniques and be confident enough to answer 'why' ADAM\/SGD instead on 'when' :p. And do brush up on some leetcode because like it or not, the team that you want to join will hear about you only if you can clear that hackerank test.\nAbout the importance of courses, nada. I know two professors in India who offer good DL courses and one of them is moving to the US. And besides, I'm not sure how many universities have good computation resources to run experiments anyways.",

Basic, but well taught and focused well on PyTorch. What I didn't like is that it lacks more advanced content. As such it feels a bit shallow when compared to the other courses. Not bad for beginners though, especially if you're looking to learn PyTorch.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Very well taught\n\n\\- Basics covered well, lots of time spent on Neural Nets and CNNs\n\n\\- Transfer Learning is well taught\n\n\\- Teaches PyTorch very well\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Only covers the basics and doesn't go into more advanced territory\n\n\\- Lacks cool projects\n\n**Score - 4.2\/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Computer Vision - Convolutional Neural Networks](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/lecture\/convolutional-neural-networks\/computer-vision-Ob1nR) \\- by Andrew Ng\n\n**Review** \\- Excellent Course! I didn't know why I didn't do this sooner! Complex concepts are broken down so well by Andrew Ng. However, it sort of jumps into the complex code a bit quick. Lots of courses tend to do this. It feels like a typical college course where you're taught the theory but not the execution.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Very well taught! Perhaps the best explanations of any course here.\n\n\\- Covers the key concepts of CNNs, Object Detection very well!\n\n\\- Covers mostly all the key CV topics\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Not a big picture or big project type course, the code you do is more about understanding the principles rather than doing something impressive.\n\n\\- It's not a course that will teach u to do things, rather it's focused on understanding what you're doing.\n\n\\- Can be expensive since it's $49\/mo but if you finish it within that month or even the 7\/day trial it's an excellent value.\n\n**Score - 4.5\/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning and Computer Vision A-Z\u2122: OpenCV, SSD & GANs](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/computer-vision-a-z\/) \\-  Created by [Hadelin de Ponteves](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/computer-vision-a-z\/#instructor-1), [Kirill Eremenko](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/computer-vision-a-z\/#instructor-2), [SuperDataScience Team](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/computer-vision-a-z\/#instructor-3)\n\n**Review** \\- **UPDATE**: I initially gave this course a relatively poor review, but I realized I had mistakenly confused some of the content with another [course](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/advanced-computer-vision\/). This course was very good. The problem I had is that it's not good for actually learning Computer Vision core basics. You'll be able to do a few fun projects after, but it doesn't teach you principles and how to do a lot of this on your own custom projects. Overall though, it's well presented and taught well.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- Good variety of core content\n\n\\- His code works (always a plus since libraries and packages get updated frequently)\n\n\\- Fun projects\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Little core basics as it's more of a cookbook type course. Other courses are like this, but many teach the basics before moving onto a project.\n\n\\- Some fluff and overly long videos. A bit inconsistent in what's taught well and what's skimmed.\n\n**Score - 4.2\/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning\/) \\-  Created by [Jose Portilla](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning\/#instructor-1)\n\nI enjoyed this course quite a bit. It's not a Deep Learning course though, at most he has a basic intro to using Keras, and how to implement CIFAR10 and MNIST, but those things are everywhere. The OpenCV and CV Basics are taught very well! And I like his voice and positivity. He's a good teacher and does it well.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers the basics of OpenCV well\n\n\\- All code works\n\n\\- Has a Deep Learning section for added value\n\n\\- The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- The Deep Learning stuff is basic and pretty much fluff to boost the 'value' of this course. It's very basic and can be found elsewhere for free\n\n\\- It doesn't have that many cool projects to do\n\n**Score 4.3\/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning Computer Vision\u2122 CNN, OpenCV, YOLO, SSD & GANs](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/master-deep-learning-computer-visiontm-cnn-ssd-yolo-gans\/?couponCode=REDDIT) \\-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python\/#instructor-1)\n\nI loved this course! It was my go-to reference for doing so many things. The content in this course is insane and he provides a full Virtual Machine with everything pre-installed (useful as all code works perfectly!). The explanations are very good. He doesn't always go into detail, but when he does it's taught quite well. The only issue I have is that I can see beginners sometimes being turned off since he rarely explains the code. He's more like \"here's the code that does this, this line this and this function was built to do this\". If you're a beginner it's understandable you'd be confused. However, the code, content, and number of projects were far more than the other courses, probably even put together (except for the PyImage course, but we'll get there). So to me, it's worth it. It covers all the details of Computer Vision rather than just pieces that look cool.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content regarding using PaperSpace and deploying your CV model on AWS as an API (quite cool!)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Amazing and detailed content\n\n\\- Excellent theoretical explanations\n\n\\- Shows you how to get the best performance out of a CNN and built a variety of things\n\n\\- Very fun projects!\n\n\\- An enthusiastic teacher who you can tell has a passion for CV\n\n\\- New content always being added it seems!\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Not for absolute beginners, now none of these courses are, but this one goes from easy to relatively hard quickly.\n\n\\- Instructor at times talks too fast and skims explanations of code\n\n\\- Some of the content is text, not video, so I didn't increase the score, but noted it regardless. Not really a con to be perfectly fair.\n\n**Score 4.6\/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Computer Vision Intro\u2122 OpenCV4 in Python with Deep Learning](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python\/?couponCode=REDDIT) \\-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python\/#instructor-1)\n\nThis is the older course of instructor above and it shows, it's been updated quite a bit, but some of the videos aren't the same as the code he provides. That isn't a deal breaker and he does mention it, but it sometimes does make you wonder if was a mistake or intentional. That said, all code is compatible with OpenCV4 which is awesome. Also, the number of projects makes it quite a nice course to get some good practical OpenCV knowledge. A Virtual Machine is also provided (nice touch!). This course has some excellent OpenCV tutorials, fun projects and there is some added Deep Learning stuff so it's quite cool, not as much fluff and good explanations again.\n\n**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content such as using Caffee models in OpenCV to colorize black and white images and some other object detection stuff, really cool projects but not explained in too much depth, still cool regardless!\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Easy to follow and I feel more of the OpenCV basics were thought\n\n\\- All code works and explanations are on point!\n\n\\- Bonus Deep Learning stuff\n\n\\- Fun Projects\n\n\\- Enthusiast Lecturer\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Audio bad at some times (not much, maybe like 20 mins appears to have been recorded with his laptop mic vs external mic)\n\n\\- The code in the videos is not always the same as the downloadable code he provides\n\n**Score - 4.3\/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision (Udemy)](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/advanced-computer-vision\/?couponCode=REDDITCV)  \\- Created by  [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/user\/lazy-programmer\/)\n\n**UPDATE**: I went back to this course and realized I might have unfairly slammed it. If you want exactly what's offered (look at the syllabus, it's taught really well). But as a standalone CV course, it's lacking.\n\nI enjoyed this course, it doesn't cover very much but it does some of the basics fairly well. What I liked was that it moved relatively slow and spent a while on some details. It goes into good detail about implementing and building the CNN's he teaches. Overall, good course, just not as much wide content as some of the others but still good at what it does!\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Covers a few topics, but covers them well\n\n\\- If you like code-along courses this is for you\n\n\\- Explains Neural Style Transfers and VGG well\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- He doesn't step outside a few things, but the things he teaches are taught very well too! So it's not a real con per se\n\n\\- Code along courses are good, but tend to waste a lot of time for me. I get why many people like it, but to me, it slows me down (could just be my impatience)\n\n\\- It lacks a wide variety of projects\n\n**Score - 4.3\/5**\n\n**NOTE**: The lazyprogrammer has a second course that seems quite good on GANs and Variational Autoencoders\n\n [https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/deep-learning-gans-and-variational-autoencoders\/?couponCode=REDDITCV](https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/deep-learning-gans-and-variational-autoencoders\/?couponCode=REDDITCV) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python - Practitioner Bundle](https:\/\/www.pyimagesearch.com\/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book\/) \\- Created by [Adrian Rosebrock](https:\/\/www.pyimagesearch.com\/author\/adrian\/)\n\n(**NOTE** Adrian provided a 10% Coupon:  **reddit**)\n\nThis is the mother load. Absolute perfect and monster of a course! Now it's expensive compared to the others, but this course teaches almost everything you'll need. I wish the ImageNet Bundle was included at this price, but that module is over $600. This course covers all key areas of Deep Learning in Computer Vision. It does not have any OpenCV (well some, but PIL or imultils are used more often). The videos aren't detailed, you're paying for the detailed textbooks, the videos are pretty much overviews of each chapter. So, yes the course material and code is where the value is, and it's excellent in quality!\n\nThe code isn't always super easy to follow, but he explains almost every line in the book so it's not a complaint, just stating that this isn't a course that's going to be easily accessible to begineers. Also, like some of the others above, it comes with a Virtual Machine with all packages pre-installed.\n\n**UPDATE**: I initially rated the value of this course as 3.5\/5 but I'm bumping it 4.1. Adrian and his community will offer to very good help to your research projects etc. So if you're stuck on need advice, it's valuable. Rajeev and Jose will often offer similar support in their Udemy forums, but Adrian's depth and expertise shines if the problem is particularly hard or grounding breaking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Pros:**\n\n\\- Probably the best resources for Practical Deep Learning Computer Vision online\n\n\\- Excellent explanations by a very experienced and passionate teacher\n\n\\- All code is explained nicely\n\n\\- Because of his experience, you know he covers the most relevant and important topics\n\n**Cons:**\n\n\\- Not for beginners, obviously, but it should be noted if you're a beginner you will feel overwhelmed going into this course\n\n\\- Explanations on video are mostly fluff, he doesn't really teach. It's more of an overview of what's covered in the book (which is the real meat of the course)\n\n\\- Expensive!\n\n**Score - 4.5\/5**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though I initially rated Rajeev's Udemy course the highest, it's only because of the insanely cheap price of $10. It's a great course and I keep coming back to it a lot. That said, when it goes up against Adrian's $300. It can't compete with the detail and explanations offered in Adrian's text. And I don't know how I missed Andrew Ng's Coursera's course, but the theory explanations in that course are best out all so far (Rajeev and Adrian do an excellent job too).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NOTE**: I got around to reviewing Adrian's other bundles. I have a friend who purchased the ImageNet Bundle and he lent me the printed text (which has been updated since). But I don't have access to the videos. Here's a quick summary of the PyImage 3 Bundles\n\n* STARTER BUNDLE - Very good value and an excellent resource. Covers all the basics in detail but doesn't get into more advanced and cooler areas of computer vision such as Object Detection and advanced CNNs.\n* PRACTITIONER BUNDLE - Highly recommend you purchase this instead of the Starter Bundle. It's excellent and covers pretty much everything you'd need to know in Computer Vision Deep Learning\n* ImageNet Bundle - It's excellent, but to me not really worth double the price of the Practitioner Bundle. It does have some nice projects and some advanced stuff. I was impressed nevertheless, but in terms of actual theory and knowledge, it's not much new content when compared to Practitioner Bundle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary, I'll put it like this. For a $10 Udemy course, Rajeev's course will take you from beginner to a working professional. But to be an expert, you'll need Adrian's (of PyImage) course. Andrew Ng's course will ensure you're understanding key concepts right, it's brilliant in breaking down the theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions on the above courses.",

        "body": "This post only addresses to people who are in college. I don't mean to discourage you but there are things other than AI\/ML that you have to learn. Do not have great pride if you used Tensorflow to \"make a machine learning model\" and don't call yourself an ML engineer. If you don't know the math, don't know how shit works, then shut up. Learn and then call yourself a ML scientist or ML Engineer. EVERYBODY knows how much of an \"ML Engineer\" you are in second year of engineering.\n\nIt is pissing off looking at how great these people think they are because they could build something that classifies a cat and a dog or some similar thing from a Udemy \/ Udacity course. Below is my fuckall rant about these fuckall people. If you care to read.\n\nSo, my company got on some bandwagon to include student developers and shortlisted people only on resume. Neither did I ask nor did I want any interns, but I was given interns. Now, I have no clue how skilled these people are and what they know. I work odd hours and am usually busy, but I wanted to give these people a platform.  Obviously I can't expect or give them production code to debug or fix, so I had to basically create tasks for them. I didn't have the chance to even speak to one of them before hiring, but I was told that they were told the role would involve Java and JUnit Testing. \n\nThe first day, I wanted to just know how much they know and asked them basic OOPs questions and even without attempting to answer the questions, 8\/10 people ask me why they're being asked Java stuff and why can't they be given ML stuff because they've experience. There is scope for ML in my team, but I can't trust students with the kind of data we work with and there are actual ML engineers who've been working in this field working on problems. \n\nI didn't know what they expected, so I told them to get started with writing JUnit test cases for some of our prototypes or they could start working on some internal prototype application in any framework of their choice. Either way, it was either testing or app \/ web development. No fancy ML stuff. I assigned them a mentor to approach for any doubts they have.\n\nBefore the end of the day, I had 4 emails requesting for a 1-on-1 meeting. I talk to them and its the same shit again. They want to do ML work and they're practically demanding I assign them ML work because they know there is ML work. I tell them that the data we work with can not be shared that easily and that they were not interviewed for this. But still, they're telling me how every company outside is offering ML work and we are giving the \"dirty\" work to interns. I tell them I'll see what can be done and told them I'll get back by Monday. The feedback from their mentor is that they don't know how to code anything in Java. Anything, at all. He gave them basic debugging tasks and they have no clue how to use a debugger. They don't know any of the design patterns. They know nothing but they want to do ML stuff, even when they were clearly told that they'd be working with Java or JUnit. I even made an exception to give them other projects because they didn't do java in college in depth and offered to provide them Java training (which is very relevant and paid for by the company with certification), but they still want to do ML.\n\nUntil here, is fine. I have dealt with a lot of people like this because I keep talking to university students. Where I totally lost it was, today I get a call from the father of one of the interns. He is in the senior management in some other company and he is asking me what is wrong in giving his talented son ML jobs. He then proceeds to tell me how the generation has changed, nobody uses Java and ML is the future and all. At this point, everything is looking like a meme come true. But this guy is serious. This guy thinks, if you can copy paste code and get something running, you can do ML stuff everywhere.\n\nSeriously, if you are a university student and one of these \"ML\/DL\/AI\/Blockchain\/NN\/XYZ Enthusiasts\", either find an internship that is specific to that area or don't be so rigid. The world is much more bigger than your small bubble and nobody owes you anything. Its not like there are surplus jobs that you can demand these things at such a junior level and learn to be humble. That thing pays off more than any of your worthless Youtube certifications. \n\nSorry for the harsh language, but this intern has managed to successfully ruin my weekend after that stupid 30 minute lecture from his dad and I am just too pissed.",

        "body": "Do it only if you're really sure about it. The tech media keeps hyping everyday about AI and ML potentially changing the world. Yes it can, but we have a long way to go. \n\nWith respect to the job itself, it genuinely isn't as glamorous as it sounds. You won't be building models everyday using scikit learn or tensorflow. Most of your day to day work will be moving data from the data warehouse into one of the many pipelines for cleaning the data, transforming it etc. Depending on your seniority and organisation, you may develop models or merely implement a model designed by a research scientist. Most research scientists in my org hold a PhD.\n\nAnd finally, once a model deployed to prod, you'll also have to maintain the model. This involves continously monitoring the performance and then tweaking hyperparameters. Concept drift is a very real thing and you'll frequently have to discard the model you painstakingly built over several weeks.\n\nYou'll also have to deal with clueless management folks who buy into the whole \"AI is a magic wand and can solve everything\". Communication is the key and while it is not mandatory, learning some principles of data visualization is very useful. Another thing to note is that a lot of folks starting off in the field consider it \"cool\"  to throw a neural net at everything while looking down on the tried and tested algos like decision trees and SVMs. Don't fall into this trap. Always start simple and then add complexity if and only if you have the data and the necessity. \n\nThat being said, if you want to invest yourself completely into data science, first and foremost, immerse yourself in the math. While it is very tempting to do a course on Udacity, and call a few libraries and then put up a certificate on LinkedIn that you've passed that course, it doesn't count for much when you encounter a problem you haven't seen before or when the data isn't provided to you so neatly. If you intend to remain in the field for the long term, get comfortable reading research papers. Arxiv is an excellent place to keep yourself aware of what's happening in the field. You'll most likely get overwhelmed by the amount of intense research ongoing, but pick one or two areas which interest you and focus on those papers. \n\nFirst learn the math: probability, statistics, kernel methods, entropy, calculus and related topics. Big data tools like Spark are good to know as most of the pipelines will be some form of a big data system. Learn data visualization (tools like d3.js or Tableau) for communicating your ideas effectively with both tech and business folks. Learn SQL as well. It definitely helps. Both Python and R have excellent ecosystems around data science and it's worth investing yourself in one of them. I personally lean towards Python. \n\nOnce you get a good grip of things, start off by exploring contests on Kaggle. Study the solutions of the best models and see what they have done. Your first few models will suck ass and that's alright. It's how everyone starts off. And finally, try to surround yourself with more experienced folks who can mentor you. Keep a personal journal of what all you learnt and the different kinds of problems and the solutions you used. Update it frequently and you should be well on your way. \n\nCheers.",

Everything in your body is telling you to go slower, to slow down because you\u2019re going to kill yourself. But no.  \n\nYou have your marker for braking (these guys pick spots on the track to hit the brakes, it might be a black line, piece of uneven track, whatever) and you know you can hit the brakes there and everything will be fine. But that\u2019s not fast, and that\u2019s the whole point. \n\nSo you push the braking marker a little later, and hope. Hope that you didn\u2019t use too much of your tire, hope the track is clean where you are about to throw it in, hope the guy behind you isn\u2019t going to try and pass you on the inside, you just hope. \n\nNow, you have to remain calm.  If you apply the brakes too hard, it will upset the bike and you will crash. If you apply them in an inconsistent manner, it will upset the bike and you will crash. Not to mention if you were wrong, you will run wide and run wide and hurt your chances of winning. \n\nThen after the turn, time to get on the throttle. The earlier the better. But oh, say you get on a little too early and too hard.  The next thing you know you are 5 feet above your bike looking down at it because you just highsided. As you\u2019re flipping through the air you know it\u2019s going to hurt, and you hope another bike doesn\u2019t run you over. Oh you also know you are about to break some bones and be in the hospital. \n\nNow do the above 100 times in a row, and do it perfect. Thats the tldr of motorcycle racing.  No room for errors because errors mean hospital, death, or a wheelchair. \n\nThe guys (and girls, because some of the girls coming through 300 twins in moto America are fast). Are superstars.

Detroit was what you call a 'street circuit' these days but in those days safety standards weren't what they are today so the edge of the track was just a series of concrete blocks lined up. \nSenna had made a mistake trying to overtake a driver on the 2nd lap, he had spun and was trying to recover the positions he'd lost when he crashed out by hitting the wall (i.e. one of these concrete blocks).\n\nWhen he was debriefing with his engineer after the race he said he couldn't understand why he had crashed, refusing to admit he'd simply made a mistake. \"It's impossible I hit the wall, the wall moved\" he said.\n\n\"Sure it did\", his engineer replied but Senna insisted so eventually they agreed to go and take a look at the scene of the incident. Sure enough. Another driver had touched the far end of one of the blocks which had caused the leading edge to be pushed out. His engineer later said \"he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres, and I\u00b4m talking probably ten millimetres, were enough for him to hit the wall that time rather than just miss it. That really opened my eyes. I knew the guy was good but that really told me how special. Not just the driving but this conviction, the analysis and then the conclusion: I cannot be wrong, so the wall must have moved. Everyone else would say, \u2018Bollocks, how on earth did I do that? \u2018 But the conviction he had was just staggering. And he was right\u201d.\n\nRacing drivers, and especially the greats like Senna, truly are a different breed.",

My dad was getting ready to leave for work when he gets a call from his buddy, mind you this is around 2 or 3 in the morning. He answers, and the guy is freaking out saying he was driving home, saw some woman standing in the middle of the road, swerved to miss her, and she dove under his truck and he ran her over. The guy was asking my dad what to do. They called the plant supervisor about it and he told them about all the shit that goes on down there on those roads, said next time dont swerve out of the way and to always carry. From then on my dad said he took those roads as close to 100 mph as he could with his pistol on his hip. He never ran into any himself, but he rather not risk it. I'm sure he still has some photos of the truck that hit the woman somewhere.",

        "body": "Independence Day in 2018 is more about a day off from school \/ work than anything else.\n\nThe bitter side of the Indian Independence is primarily felt by older Indians who lived in the areas affected by the partition in 1947. States on the Pakistan \/ India \/ Bangladesh border suffered tremendous economic and personal losses. These people will tell you stories of losing all their property and businesses, losing family members during the riots or robberies and having to move away from their loved ones who belong to different religions. The core of India did not suffer any pains from the partition process, and so the pain doesn't resonate in their minds as much as it does in the minds of the states on the border.\n\nIf you're the average Indian celebrating Independence Day, you would spend the morning watch the national parade live from New Delhi but this isn't  as popular as it was 15 years ago.\n\nIf you're a student, or are kin of some school student you might attend a cultural show put up by the school. Usually kids will perform acts centered around the popular freedom fighters.\n\nYour local mall maybe decorated in orange, white and green to attract your attention.\n\nAll this is to say, that like any nation moving away from it's original independence day, India finds this day less and less significant every year. This isn't to cast doubts on India's self-reflection, its normal. And the first things we are forgetting, are the struggles of a small subset of Indians living on the border.\n\nTLDR; No, Independence Day is not usually seen as a bittersweet event because the bitter events affected only few states, and the rest of India is blissfully ignorant of that in today's day & age. It's a lot like the American Thanksgiving where it's more about the family dinners and shopping while forgetting about the Day of Mourning, as observed by the Native Americans.",

        "body": "Just came back from my first three month long trip from America. Listed below in no particular order things that shocked me.\n\n1. Airports in America are RUDE. My bag lock got broken on the way and there was a huge poster inside which said TSA. I checked out with my friends there and apparently it is typical. Interestingly most of my indian friends there justified this as being required for America's security - I didnt really get it because I would have been more than happy to open my bag, or keep it open if someone would have asked, so there was no need of breaking the locks - amusingly all Americans I talked to about it said that TSA are a bunch of rogues - go figure.\n\n2. America is astonishingly beautiful. The skys are bluer and the water is clearer. The mountains are freaking huge and there are roads all over. Just rent a car and keep driving. They have a gazillion national parks and all of them kept in pristine state. I think America should stop doing everything and just open its borders for tourists.\n\n3. Politics is exactly like India. Ask any ordinary American and he will tell you why the govt does not work anymore, nothing gets done and how politicians keep squandering to every vote bank life right and center. The state of california has what is very close to a 'referendum' system where the people can vote directly on laws and the residents describe it as the biggest reason why nothing gets done in California.\n\n4. American school system is a cluster fuck. Basically, the idea is that if you want to send your kid to a good school, you cant just go, pay the high fees and get him admitted. What you do instead is go buy an expensive house near the school so that you 'belong' to that district and then pay the local council fees and then your kid can go to the school for 'free'. This is somewhat similar to you giving a 'donation' to get your child admitted to a school with low fees and then calling it 'cheap'. If you cant buy the house, you are out of luck. The poor schools in America are exponentially worse than the others - drugs, guns and sex are available too early and too much.\n\n5. America is EXTREMELY segregated. Blacks live in black areas. Whites live in white areas. Blacks dont go into white areas. Whites dont go to black areas. No big deal. Blacks to this date face an overwhelming amount of institutional\/social racism  - but this changes depending on who you ask.\n\n6. Indians\/immigrants cluster around known spaces - big cities like ny, sf, chicago and do not go much into 'inner' America. Apparently, inner America is not so accomodating to immigrants and there is a lot of crime. Even when they do travel to 'inner' America they keep to the roads and big hotels, barely heading out anywhere on their own.\n\n7. Even in big cities immigrants\/indians dont really mingle with anyone. Indians hang out with other indians only and hang out with the locals a bit at work. The locals also don't like to mix too much with other races and keep on their own. (Source: an american who I had a frank chat with). Everyone though comes out as incredibly friendly.\n\n8. There is a LOT of mugging in America. All my friends who have been in America have been mugged atleast once, at gun point. The first caution I received on my trip was to hand over ALL of my money if I am getting mugged because people get shot more often than not. There are crime areas clearly demarcated in every city and all Indians studiosly stay away. Apparently, Indians are the easiest target. Also, NEVER leave your laptop bag in the car - glass will get broken and laptop stolen.\n\n9. Healthcare is a huge mess. 60-70% of Americans do not have comprehensive health insurance and any serious illness can bankrupt them if it is not covered. To give you an idea of how expensive the shit is, someone told me that a 5 mile ambulance ride can easily end up costing upwards of $5K if it is not covered under insurance. This is getting better with obamacare - though I couldnt get my head around to it. There is massive abuse in the system because doctors over-prescribe tests\/medications because of fear of litigation and because the patients dont pay in a lot of cases. A lot of these tests are not required and more often than not harmful for the patients.\n\n10. America does not speak English. America speaks American English. Outside of major cities, most Indians have an extremely hard time even communicating to other Americans because they dont speak American english. Learning American english is as hard as learning a new language.\n\n11. There are poor in America. In chicago people will come up to you and ask for money, or approach you if you are eating a hotdog on a food stall to give them your halfeaten hotdog. Most of them are blacks.\n\n",

A lot of people does come from the decent homes and they behave properly. But the rowdiest of the crowd is made up by the uneducated and unemployed youth. They don't have much in their lives back home and this journey is their escape. This is like the movie Purge for them. They are away from home and they are not in hurry to get back. They don't mind a little tussle with the people or law. Their regular lives are not great and from their perspective, they don't like the people driving cars and living a life much better than theirs. For them, Kawad yatra is their only opportunity to act superior to the people who have it better than them on the other days. They don't mind getting into fights or creating chaos because they don't care about the consequences. They already don't live a respectable or a decent life. How worse can it get for them? \n\nOf course, this doesn't make their behavior acceptable. And you don't need to have sympathy for them. They are a menace but it's important to understand the root cause of the problem. \n\nKawaadiyas are the small side effect of the much bigger social problem of poverty, and income inequality. If they had a decent job and life back home they wouldn't have joined the Kawad yatra in the first place and those who would've joined would have cared about the consequences of breaking the law and order.",

        "body": "Today, in a tutorial of engineering a professor of mine narrated an account of his life. It was an uplifting interaction. It seems to me that his life's description does deserve wider circulation. \n\nI'll be brief. And, in my efforts to keep this piece short there may be a lack of fluidity. Please excuse me.\n\nMy teacher was born in a rural area of a western state. His was an average family.They had land holdings and a decently performing agriculture business. His parents desired that their offspring attain a graduate degree.\n\nBeing a resident of a remote area, he didn't have access to high quality education. His communication skills were poor, unmemorable.\nWith great struggle he attained decent scores in the 12th grade.\n\nThose familiar with engineering admissions would know the importance of a decent score in entrance examinations. His father encouraged him to attend shortened sessions at coaching institutes. He performed well in the filtering process. On being granted admission to a decent engineering college in an urban area his parents were ecstatic.\n\n\nBut, he felt intimidated by this unfamiliar geography.\nHis inability to communicate prevented him from assimilating with the urbane crowd. Abandonment and isolation was suffocating.\nAnd, it reflected in his scores. He excelled in mathematics. But, his performance was unremarkable in other courses.\n\n\nBy the end of his second year in engineering he had failed in 15 subjects.\nThen the much petrifying event occurred- He was informed by the college administrator, with immense sorrow that he would have to retake his courses. My professor was devastated.\nThis distressing development stimulated thoughts of suicide.\n\n\nBut, he gathered himself. Then, sought help from his parents. They encouraged him to get involved in productive activities to spend the year and focus energy on performing well in his courses.\n\n\nHe enrolled at a TV repair workshop. It proved to be beneficial to him. It enabled the development of a nuanced understanding of electrical components. By rote learning he passed his courses.\n\n\nA year passed, he was granted admission to the third year of engineering.\nHe then doggedly studied the new subjects.\nAnd, he did well. But, his past haunted him at the time of job interviews. His marks were ordinary. Companies refused to grant him an opportunity to interact with the recruiting authority.\n\n\nDejected, he secured an employment opportunity at a local repair shop. Also, he started to teach mathematics. His monthly income was Rs. 1500. It wasn't enough to feed himself. He often pleaded with his friends to lend him some money to pay for necessities.\n\nTeaching mathematics refined his communication. He was reinvigorated and decided to take the GATE.\nAnd, he performed well. He was granted admission to a leading institute. He published several papers which received laudation.\n\nToday, he is well placed. This isn't the quintessential success story where the protagonist becomes a billionaire.\nBut, it's the fight of a common man defying odds to attain his goals.\n\nFailure shouldn't deter you from trying again.\nHe shared that two of his siblings failed multiple times in engineering. But after passage of some time, today they occupy exalted positions.\n\nTough times won't last. For alleviation of suffering don't resort to activities that could ruin you.\n\nBe tenacious. There will be better days.\n",

Not just any, but **a very good one** that too. Talking really helps and they may help you determine whether you need medication or not. My therapist helped me immensely and while I may still have some problems with developing and maintaining hobbies, I've started enjoying life so much more than I did before. So yeah, don't go expecting a miracle cure; it takes a lot of time to get out of this hopeless state.\n\nPS: please don't avoid people.

Primarily, I am screening for (1) work-life-balance (2) professional advancement and (3) comfort\/happiness.\n\n**Disclaimers:**\n\nBefore we dive into the cheat-sheet, a few important disclaimers.  This cheat-sheet is NOT designed to get you hired, in fact, it's designed to do the opposite.  It's designed for cynical \"old\" bastards who don't want to waste their time on high-stress, unfulfilling, abusive, or low-quality jobs.\n\nSome of these aren't \"questions,\" but rather research items.  I don't ask every question in every interview, but I'm also not afraid to ask multiple interviewers the same question to see if they're genuine or polishing a turd.  The cheat-sheet is intended to be concise, not precisely worded, so phrase these however comes across naturally.\n\nIf you're unproven and have few job prospects, you may wish to be \"tactful\" in regards to some of the work-life-balance questions.  You may also wish to defer questions like \"do you offer free lunches,\" and instead do research on their careers page, glassdoor, or simply taking careful note of the office-environment when you do the on-site.\n\nIf you don't understand why I ask some of these questions, just ask, I'd be happy to share.  Feel free to add your own, or provide feedback.  Enjoy!\n\n-----\n\n\n**Interviewer**\n\n* Name - (Write it down!)\n* Your role?

        "body": "It was a long time ago, I'd say around 300-400 meters? Maybe a little less? \n\nWe were moving towards what we'd figured was a nest of fighters, slipping thru the grape  and marijuana fields of Khandahar Province. We were single-file, as the Towlies there loved to use dismount-aimed IED's, basically booby-trap explosives in the trails and trail junctions. You'd only lose a leg or so, if you were lucky. \n\n\nI was on point, with our Troop CO, who just fucking happened to be out at our COP(Combat Outpost), and insisted on going on patrols with us so he could \"seem like one of the Troopers.\" We hated him, for a variety of reasons, but that's another story.\n\n\nIt was my day to take my squad out, long story short, we take contact and get involved in a running fight for several hours. We'd finally got several of them cornered in their \"nest\" and were preparing to root them out. I was down behind a wall, gasping for breath and trying to wargame a quick flanking tactic with my two fireteam leaders and the ANA (Afghan National Army) troops with us. The CO MBITR was dead, so I was handling all traffic back to the COP. I'd given them coor'ds to where we though the Towlies were, and what we were about to do.\n\n\nWe were at the edge of an open field, and we had to cross, exposing ourselves. I set some of my Joes on overwatch\/cover fire, and I say \"Ok, me and Captain Smith(Our CO, not his real name) will go first. Cover us, and then you two\"...and so on till we all got across. \n\n\nI barely get the words out, and I'm not even set to run, and Captain \"Smith\" (being the fuckwit that he was) jumps up and starts gangling his lanky, stupid self across the field.\n\nAlone.\n\nBefore I even ensured that my Joes are covering us.  I can only assume he'd seen this in a movie or in his wet-dreams or something.\n\n\nI jump up and begin to sprint after him, and just as I do, my platoon net crackles, \"Blue 2, Blue 2, DANGER CLOSE, fast-movers on your pos to strike last given coordinates!\" \n\n\nSome fucktard up at the Squadron level decided to use the fast movers that had been buzzing around all day doing jack shit, to hit these guys for us.\n\n\nAnd as the guy relaying the call to me from our COP was one of my junior NCO's (we loved each other, and still talk, great guy), he breaks radio protocol and just goes \"BOSS! BOSS! PULL 'EM BACK, THEY'RE FUCKING NUKING THOSE TOWLIES!! PULL BACK!!\" \n\nI'll never forget the fear in his voice....\n\n\nSo anyway, there I was, chasing after Captain Down Syndrome, while trying to duck sporatic SAF, yell to my guys to stay put, yell on the net, and run.\n\n\nI catch Captain Fuckwit in about 50 meters, tackle him from behind, slam us both into a shallow depression, and scream in his face \"DANGER CLOSE! THEY'RE DROPPING A FUCKING GBU!!\"\n\n\nHe has no idea what I'm talking about as his coms are dead, but his face turns white. I just lay beside him, praying that fucking pilot didn't miscalculate. I just thought, \"goddamnit, if I'm going to die here, I'll have to die with this idiot, and not capable Scouts. Fuck.\"\n\nMy boy at the COP relays the countdown, \"10 seconds!\" I relay to my Squad on their net....\"5 seconds!\".....\n\n\nBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!\n\nI think I lifted off the ground, lol. The earth shook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was a wild year. I'd done Iraq three times before that Afghanistan deployment, and I thought I'd seen it all. I could go on for hours, that tour was a deadly comedy of errors.\n\n\n\n",

The older ones where a bit less forgiving than the new ones, but the GT is a light powerful V10 made between 04 and 07. Designed for Le Mans but cut last minute to not face the R8, it is a race car. Owning a race car doesn't make you a race car driver. An oil spot, some gravel, or just some wheel slip under throttle can send that bitch all over the road. Fucking tragic that this happened, but as someone who has driven high performance cars I can understand pushing it a little hard for a gear head friend. I hope one day his family and fans can remember him for his accomplishments and not the way he died. ",

It's actually much worse. The truth is that, especially in a country with as weak a social safety net as India, it is nearly impossible to experience consistent happiness if you don't have enough money.\n\nChildren who grow up with modest means (hello, me), and deal with the constant stress and traumas associated with that, continue to experience the negative effects of that period through their entire lives -- even if they personally become more wealthy. There is a funny sort of \"purchase guilt\" that sticks with you for a lifetime, even when you can easily afford the purchase.\n\nIf my parents prioritized nurturing relationships or friendships rather than chasing money, we wouldn't have food on our plates. I am not even exaggerating here, I wish I was. I grew up in a happy household with low income but it was sometimes so bad that my father had to make me drop out of a private school and attend government school to save money for my little brother's private school fees. My father believed 'our foundation' needs to be good.\n\nMy parents have struggled all their lives to give us a 'good lifestyle', education and values. My brother and I are ingrained to believe that we have to work really hard to have a good lifestyle, give our parents the life they could never afford and never to go back to how we lived before which I can say is true for most of us middle class kids. We are running after money and don't make us feel bad for chasing comfort and financial security.",

If you're earning 10 lacs a month you wouldn't mind spending 5000 on an air ticket. Yes, air travel is far costlier, because usually the city will be on Earth and airport will be built in Proxima Centauri, so the cost of getting to the airport and back is nearly same as flight charges.\n\nBut, on the other hand, on trains you have to deal with bachelors playing cards, unkills and aunties unwrapping their food on the ground and handing it to their 10,000 kids who are all occupying the same berth, a marriage party singing bollywood songs all through the night, that awkwardly staring guy who doesn't have a ticket and is waiting to bribe the TC, but has for whatever reason chosen to sit right next to you while doing said act of waiting for the TC, no functional toilet (there is a hole with with some brown substance that people sometimes use but it can't be called a toilet), cab drivers who fleece you at the station, generally rude staff in case you have any inquiries etc. etc. So to avoid all that people prefer to travel by air, IF they have the money for it. You don't save much time and definitely don't save any money. It is simply the convenience.\n\nThink of it as eating a masala dosa from the roadside eatery next to your house vs eating it in a high-end restaurant like Tabla. Both taste the same and have the same nutritional value (in fact the road side one might actually taste better), but people go to Tabla for the ambience and to avoid having to push and pull and wait for the dosa on the street.",

I swear, it had to be similar to what going into a coma feels like. \n\n14 hours later and I was back to normal, and it felt like an accomplishment. My sleep bank was finally full. I could go another 3 days on pills and caffeine.

What does that even mean? A new car, a great career, family?  I'm upper middle class now yet, even when I was a gas station attendant, I was able to make a difference for people- I remember the guy who dropped his wallet with $900 and I only made $450 a month. When I handed him back his wallet full of cash he looked like he believed in miracles.\n\nPerhaps the things to strive for in life are being of service? Practicing kindness? Connecting with others? Seeking balance?\n\nI no longer try to be happy. Happiness is a mood.  Mood is like ocean waves that can be unpredictable, uplifting at one moment and crushing at the next. I no longer seek happiness from others or try and change my mood with alcohol or external forces. The daily grind of doing right (years), for me, alone and over time, has created a life that I can be content with.\n\nWhat works for me is to serve others, strive for balance, and live in the now. Despite my history or maybe because of it, I am content. That doesn't change my past or my history of abuse or my history of questionable choices.  But here in the now, still alone, I feel like it is enough.\n\nI have hope. For all of us.\n\n\n\nEdit:  thank you for the gold kind stranger.  I'm humbled and grateful my life lessons resonated.

Now either you could stand there and go on reiterating the fact that this is a shitty work (which everyonearound knows) or you could accept it as it is and get done with it and move away from that shit.\n\nRemember one thing in life, the only thing that makes someone great is their attitude towards life, nothing else.  N I think whenever you sign up for any game (in sports or in life) you play with the rules of the game, not by your likings or dislikings. N you have to be the best in every part of it, if you want to succeed (no matter how shitty it is).\n\n Notice one thing while you are in college. There would be some students who are always good at anything they sign up for. They might not ace all of them, but they are among the leaders on the scoreboard. Note their names. I bet you those kids will make big in life. Coz they have the thing I want you\u200b to appreciate. \n\nThey have the knack to win, no matter what the price or the rules are. The kind of attitude \"Fuck it, as long as I'm involved I have to win\" is all that I'm talking about. Because many times by belittling the prize or mocking the rules, we are somewhere trying to hide our incapabilities. Not always the case, but most of the time.

In general light colored shirt, dark trousers, darker shoes.\n\n2. Speaking of shoes: a pair of black shoes and a pair of brown shoes will suffice. Buy a reversible (black and brown) belt. Match the belt to the shoe.\n\n3. Ties: only two are needed: black and blue. \n\n4. For casuals. T-shirts only 3 to begin with: white, blue and grey. Jeans : one blue and one black. Will suffice.\n\nYou'll have plenty to start off with. \n\n**Far more importantly:**\n\n5. Fit is your friend. Most shops won't go beyond altering the length of the trousers. ( Super useful information to remember). Shirts and t-shirts can and should be altered. Find a good tailor for that. Just ask him to make your shirts fitting (in hindi - \"is shirt ki fitting kar do). He'll do the needful. Its cheap. You'll look better.\n\n*If you gain weight, the fit shirt will become ill-fitting.*\n\n**Even more importantly:**\n\n5. Read about male fashion. Look up \/r\/malefashionadvice\/.

Jae-In and Dan Yu were outnumbered 10 to 1, but they were ready. \n\nStill at a trot Jae In began to direct measured, accurate fire at the Northerners. The first fell, then the second, before a third spotted the pair of Soldiers, in an open field, daring to oppose them. A cry came from the Northerners and they began to return fire. Bullets zinged around Jae-Ins feet as DanYu wrested a fresh magazine from Jae In's custom back mounted mag pouches and Jae In grunted in thanks as he took the mag from Dan Yu's mouth and slapped it into his rifle. \n\nThe defector was gasping for air, totally spent, but doggedly running half bent over toward the looming DMZ Fence. The Northern Soldiers had taken cover to return fire though, buying the defector precious yards in his flight. Jae In and Dan Yu looked like they were chiseled from granite in the twilight as the defector passed where they stood. \n\nAnd then it happened, a Northerner, apparently in charge, had slapped and cajoled his men into some semblance of discipline. They began to direct fire more accurately. A bullet ripped the sleeve of Jae In's starched uniform. Another creased the helmet of Dan Yu. And then Jae In Fell, shot in the thigh. For a moment, all Jae In could see was a throbbing darkness, when he came to he saw the defector sagging over the DMZ concrete barrier, a troop of South Korean soldiers en route on foot at top speed. But the bullets still ripped the dirt around him. He knew it was over. \n\nAnd then, through the noise and the chaos and the throbbing in his leg, he felt a tug on his uniform, felt his body pulled haltingly towards the fence. A pause, a tug, mere inches, but still, he was being pulled. Twisting his body, ignoring the pain that threatened to overcome him, he looked over his shoulder, and saw the helmeted form of Dan Yu. He had a ragged hunk of Jae-In's uniform in his mouth, and a look of supreme determination on his face. \n\n\nAs his vision faded, he struggled to utter the words that they would both remember with utter clarity the rest of their long lives. \n\n'Dan Yu, Forget about Me, Don't...^^don't...^^don't... ^^^don't'\n\n\n",

I'll retell it as I remember it, which might be incorrectly. In the dream, she was in a public bathroom that she didn't recognize. She heard crying in one of the stalls and approached it with an overwhelming feeling of dread. She opened the door to the stall and that's when she always woke up, completely terrified but unable to recall what was in the stall. Months after she stops having the dreams, she's traveling and in an airport in a different state. She walks into the airport bathroom and recognizes it as the one from her dream. One stall is closed and she can hear what sounds like crying coming from inside. Obviously horrified, she turns around and immediately leaves the bathroom.

        "body": "So you've seen my \"Emigrate\" nonsense and are thinking of biting the bullet? Fair warning, this is not something you can do overnight. It is also a long process that depends on a fair bit of luck and requires stomach for risk. Be warned, emigration takes years of planning and years of work and integration before you are able to say \"I emigrated\". It is not easy and there are few shortcuts.\n\n#What benefits will you get\n-You will be on the path to Western citizenship. I will not explain to you just how few benefits your Indian passport gets you and what the price of your Indian citizenship really is. *Always remember that your indian citizenship shackles you to the indian bureaucracy. You can continue to be culturally indian while enjoying the benefits of western citizenship.*\n\n-Your quality of life will improve. Period. Objectively, there is no scope for argument here unless you already have millions in the bank in which case you would not be reading this\n\n-You won't have to deal with the same set of problems that everyone (aka the salaried, income tax-paying middle class) cribs about in India but to which no one has yet found a solution. Examples include \"what will people say\", noise and air pollution, the constant hazard of food-borne disease, questionable doctors and medical treatment and a whole host of other issues\n\n-Your income will go up on a PPP level.\n\n-Your tax money will not disappear into a black hole. Roads will be driveable and you can hold public officials to account if things don't work\n\n-Opening a business is transparent and there is accountability and plenty of options for support. Opening a business in india, the less said the better.\n\n\n#What are the downsides\nThis is subjective and varies for everyone.\n\n-You may find yourself socially isolated and without any friends\n\n-You may get homesick\n\n-Your mental health may be affected\n\n-You may not find a job and may be forced to return to India saddled with debt which you will have to repay in INR\n\n-You might have to learn a new language.\n\n-On a purely numeric basis, your taxes and expenses for most items will go up\n\n-You may not like the culture and society of the country you moved to\n\n#Of course, this depends\nI work in a non-IT industry and India has very few employment opportunities for someone like me. There is zero (near as much matters) R&D in my industry in India. Salaries are are a joke. Working hours are long. I just get a better deal abroad. This may not be the case for everyone. If, like so many here, you work in IT, your opportunities may be almost the same in India and abroad. The quality of life aspect is something you cannot argue with but when the money is flowing, it becomes harder to make an argument for uprooting yourself. If you work in the medical field, you may need to study further or get licensed again. This takes time and effort. If you work in sectors such as law or the arts, I cannot comment about your employment opportunities. As a general rule, STEM degrees go further than arts degrees. Sorry, but that's just how the world works.\n\n#Someone told me that the job market in Germany is better than the Netherlands. Your comments?\nPart of the process of emigration is doing your research and learning to ask the right questions. If you are asking someone to compare job prospects in two countries, the person answering either has to be an economist or has to have worked in the same industry in both countries. The number of people who meet this requirement is vanishingly small and anyone else attempting an answer is feigning knowledge. You might as well ask a dog (or an octopus) to pick between the two choices.\n\n#What are my options\nThe traditional emigration destinations for the educated Indian has been either the USA or one of the British Commonwealth countries (the developed ones). These are good options primarily because the \"learning curve\" is less steep compared to other destinations. You already speak the language and this is a huge benefit. With the USA, it is a gamble and you might or might not be able to secure a green card. Until that point, you are on and H1B visa and your options are limited. If your visa is not renewed, you are screwed and have to leave the country as your Indian passport won't allow you the right to stay as a tourist. The educational opportunities in the USA are second to none but be aware of the pitfalls. I will leave it to others to fill in the information for the USA including the medical insurance system and school expenses for your kids.\n\nCanada and Australia offer a PR (permanent resident) program for skilled workers.\n\nCanada: https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/immigrate-canada\/express-entry\/works.html\nCanada has a points system and you stand a good chance if you score somewhere in the 400+ range. This is the easy part. The hard part is finding a job. Jobs for non-IT folks can be hard to come by and your mileage may vary. Do your research.\n\nFor Canada:\n\n>There are plenty of jobs in the engineering field that do not require a P.E. license. For example, for a civil engineer, you can start at a lower grade that doesn't require you to sign off on blueprints and designs: You can work as a site supervisor, laboratory supervisor, Civil Technologist. You can work in these fields while gaining the requisite work experience under a licensed PE to get your own license.  (Via \/u\/chronus_ess)\n\nAustralia: If you have a degree from a recignised institute, you can get an 18 month, no strings attached, work visa. https:\/\/www.homeaffairs.gov.au\/trav\/visa-1\/476-\n\nThe Australian skilled migration program is here https:\/\/www.homeaffairs.gov.au\/trav\/work\/skil\n\nIn either of these cases, you have to sit the IELTS and then provide recommendation letters from your past employers. If you are an engineer (non software \/ IT) you need to be licensed in Canada and Australia *in order to find a job* The PR process does not require a license. (corrected by \/u\/chronus_ess).\n\nSee \n\nhttps:\/\/engineerscanada.ca\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.engineersaustralia.org.au\/\n\nCanada and Australia are good options if you do not work in IT and have limited options in the USA. Research the licensing requirements as this may throw a spanner in the works. Make sure you have your documentation ready before you move there or, better still, get the process going before you move.\n\nTHe EU also offers a path to PR and citizenship provided you live in a certain country for a fixed duration, usually five continuous years, eight in others. Keep in mind that you are not allowed mobility between countries in this time period i.e. you cannot claim to have lived in the EU for a total for five years and then apply for PR in a country. Remember that the EU is not a nation and cannot issue travel documents. Only EU member states can do this. Living the EU has benefits and pitfalls. The benefits include arguably the best quality of life on the planet with government mandated annual leave quotas and year-long maternity leave, sometimes for both parents. The pitfalls inlcude the fact that the EU is a fractured continent and that there is no European identity. This leads to situations such as inter-national mobility figures being low for EU citizens themselves despite all the benefits promised by the EU single market and (EDIT) despite the fact that they are granted free movement on paper. There is the issue of language which is very important. European languages are limited in their utility and it often does not make sense investing in learning one. This is because of the limited geographic area in which they are used. Barring examples like English, French, Spanish and to an extent, German, learning any from the remaining EU languages is utterly pointless unless you have a liking for it or plan to live in a specific country. Look into the EU Blue card if you want to : http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/immigration\/bluecard_en\n\nThe EU Blue card, as it is now, is little more than yet another parallel visa system (in true European fashion) and adds little value. Most of the promised benefits are not yet recognised by member states. You cannot yet apply for PR in an EU member state based on time spent in another member state. For example, if you work in Germany on a blue card for four years and then move to Spain to work, you will have to work and live in Spain for five years before you are eligible to apply for PR. Your time spent in Germany does not count towards these five years.\n\nSalaries in the EU are good to begin with but do not grow beyond a point and are unlikely to be competitive with what the USA offers.\n\n**General comment on the EU**: Life in the EU can be great at the beginning with the culture, the architecture and the vibrancy of the place in general. Don't get lost in this. The primary difference between the EU and north America is that most white people in the EU are from the EU. This is not the case in North America, despite what people may claim. There is more acceptance in North America than there ever will be in the EU. the US and Canada are nations built on immigration. The EU Is not. Immigration is a new phenomenon in most countries there. No matter how hard you try, you will never be able to change the fact that you are not from the EU. Many Indians I've met in EU countries live like long-term tourists, never learning the language and never truly integrating. That gets tiring very quickly.\n\nAs of today, most Middle East countries do not offer (or offer limited) PR or citizenship options. Working there is good if you want to make money as income is not taxed. Your quality of life, though, might be great or it may not be great. It depends.\n\nThe Netherlands has a skilled migrant visa called the kennismigrant visa. There's also a 30% ruling that grants you 30% of your income tax-free. this makes a big difference to your in-hand income. You need a job offer to be able to apply for this.\n\nNetherlands kennismigrant (knowledge migrant) visa:  https:\/\/ind.nl\/en\/work\/Pages\/Highly-skilled-migrant.aspx\n\nDenmark's skilled visa program http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/immigration\/what-do-i-need-before-leaving\/denmark\/worker\/highly-qualified-worker_en\n\nUK Info: (See comments below https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/india\/comments\/81r29c\/your_onestop_guide_to_emigrating_long_term_to\/dv4k4sk\/)\n\n>No idea about the other categories but on a simple work visa known as a Tier 2 Visa, you are granted one for 3 years with an option to extend it by another 3 years. Once you have stayed for 5 years and provided you satisfy some easy to fulfil conditions like not being away for more than X days in the last 12 months you can apply for ILR i.e. Indefinite Leave to Remain where you can almost all rights as a citizen. After at least 12 months of this you can apply for citizenship\n\n#US Immigration info (from comments below \/u\/logicperson)\n\n>There are basically four different categories of green card wait lists\n\n>eb1(extraordinary ability): which is first category, reserved for Einstein type people, need a PhD or equivalent with good research credentials or show that you are at the top of your field (even if not technical). For eg, if you have an Olympic medal, got an Oscar, are a famous model, etc. There is one loophole which many Indian companies are exploiting here which is you can qualify here if you are an international manager. The requirement there is that you need to be employed in that capacity for one year outside the US. While it is easy for somebody in Infosys, tcs to show this, people like me working for US based corporations are at a disadvantage here. The wait for this category is 6 months to 1 year for just the processing time and you get green card after that.\n\n>Eb2(people with advanced degree): is for people like me with Masters. There is a country of birth based quota system here wherein no single country can get more than 7% of total green card numbers. Hence the wait-list for Indian born people is long, spanning decades. There is no preference given for higher income or for graduation from a reputed University. Somebody born in Iceland with inferior credentials than you can get a green card here in 1 year while you will be waiting. There is an option to get it quicker if you or your spouse are not born in India.\n\n>Eb3: same as eb2 but for only bachelor's degree holding people.\n\n>Eb5: investors green card where you need to invest $1+ million dollars (don't know the exact number). Mostly Chinese investors use this.\n\n>Me and most of my peer group are languishing in eb2 wait lists. When we came the waiting time was 2-3 years. But by the time we graduated and applied for it the time bloated up and is currently 11 years and counting.\n\n\n\n#How do i go about doing this?\n\nBroadly, you have two options. I assume that you are not rich enough to be able to afford investor visas.\n\nOption 1: Go abroad to study and then work your way from there. This requires stomach for risk and also some money in the bank. I would not recommend courses that  charge fees, especially in the EU as there are too many barriers to overcome. I would not recommend going to the UK to study because of the visa situation.\n\nI quote one of my replies here:\n\n>figure out what you want to study. which course. what is it called. try a google search for \"course name\" \"country\".\n\n>For example: electrical power engineering finland. (this is what i studied)\n\n>this throws up the following list: https:\/\/www.google.nl\/search?q=electrical+power+engineering+finland\n\n>one of the options is https:\/\/www.mastersportal.eu\/study-options\/268583006\/energy-power-engineering-finland.html\n\n>that's a good list but i'd advise you to stick to the top 1-2 universities in smaller countries like finland.\n\n>once you've found the course, look at the individual courses. i apologise for using the word \"course\" in two different ways here. at this point, start looking at the coursework. google the professors. read the titles of their publications. see what piques your interest.\n\nThe situation in the USA might be different and taking on student debt there could make sense. I will not comment on the feasability of that here. I am not an expert and know very little. The same is true for studying in Canada or Australia.\n\nIf you go abroad to study, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A PLAN B.\n\nThere is no point going to Sweden to do a PhD in gender equality studies and then crying foul when no one gives you a job. Never forget that you have lost the lottery of citizenship and to base your choices around that. Your options are limited but make sure that you are aware of all of them before embarking on a course of study abroad. It is a once in a lifetime investment and chance so don't botch it \"chasing your dreams\" if those dreams won't get you a job once you're done.\n\nit is hard work and takes time but nothing in life is ever easy :)\n\nOption 2: is to find a job while sitting outside your destination country. This is hard but not impossible if you have skills which are in demand. This is admittedly easier for people in the IT industry but it is possible for others. The main hurdles you'll face here are visa issues. Countries like the Netherlands and Germany make this process quite easy. Inform your potential employers about the visa possibilities. USe linkedin and your common sense here. There is only so much i can do to help with this. Make sure to look up visa and PR issues in your destination country. In most cases, you need a job offer to be able to go down this route.\n\nExamples: \n\nNetherlands: http:\/\/ind.nl\/en\/work\/Pages\/Highly-skilled-migrant.aspx\n\nGermany: http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/immigration\/what-do-i-need-before-leaving\/germany\/worker\/highly-qualified-worker_en\n\nFrance: http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/immigration\/what-do-i-need-before-leaving\/france\/worker\/highly-qualified-worker_en\n\n#Conclusion\n\nThere are two paths you can take. One is to stay in india, for whatever reason that may be, and crib about the situation, about how corruption ruins everything, how no one does anything to improve the country and a million other things. This path has several issues but you have to make your peace with your choice and deal with the fact that few things are within your control or power to fix. \n\nThe other path is to work hard, emigrate and live in the West. This is not easy either and involves several sacrifices but the end result is in your control and is largely determined by your own efforts.\n\nEnd of the day, there is no right or wrong choice. Objectively, life in the West is better and you get a better deal. Subjectively, it depends. Emigration involves years of hard work and starting your life from scratch in a foreign land in literally every aspect. One important tip is to embrace your new home and make it your own. Keep your friends from back home but don't depend solely on them. You'll do just fine. Remember to not shit on those who are forced to remain in india because of circumstance. it could have been you. About those who are too lazy to put in the work and simply deride your choices, remember that they are not paying your bills or improving your life in any way. Ignore them.\n\nGood luck!",

But I earn an enviable package in India, can take care of my family, parents and do what I do from India.\n\nGuys in IT have this misconception about learning on the job. In 90% of the companies there is no learning on the job once you are familiar with the basics. You work on some code and debug it. That's what the company needs from you.\n\nLearning is not limited to one's company work. What would happen if Einstein limited himself to clerical work? One learns when one is interested. If you see the IT population of India there is less than .1% chance you would get to do what you love in an IT company. Be realistic.\n\nSo what do you do? In my case I chose to work on open source outside office work. I have several software on Ubuntu officially. I learn that way. I also jump companies when I think I have learnt what I could there and move on to a newer domain I like. Officially I have worked on embedded, network protocols, gaming algorithms, bluetooth, mpeg, filesystems and OS. Today I work on storage chips. 12+ years is a long time to learn, right?\n\nSo pick up what you want to learn. Need to brush up basics? Pick the subject on Coursera. Need some hot topics? There's IoT, there's ML, ther'es Dronecode. I know profs, students from unis like MIT, Stanford who also contribute heavily to open source. It's an honor to work with them, know them. Innovation in the open source domain is overwhelming and free to access (which I why I love it so much).\n\nNo learning goes _unpaid_. The company which sees your worth will pay you the right money, give you the right job. But don't stop learning when you join it. ;)",

        "body": "I'll give it a shot too because the other explanation I thought was a bit confusing so I'll try to keep it basic.\n\nEach day during recess the trading pit on the playground is busy as can be with kids buying and selling for their parents and other adults and the market seems to grow. \n\nBob, one of the adults who has their money tied up in LOLI shares, is happy he gets to be a part of it all and is eager to see where the share price goes (hopefully up). The problem is that he also has a kid going to college soon so he actually really needs that money and can't afford to lose it. He's actually real anxious about the LOLI Corp screwing up or having a bad week and the shares plummeting down worthlessness right when tuition is due. \n\nMax, the kid who seems to have the pit all figured out, hears this and makes an offer to Bob. Max knows LOLI Corp really well, he studied their financials, he understands the market conditions, he's confident he knows what's up. He promises Bob that, only if Bob later decides he wants to, Max will buy the shares off him at a set price of say $1000 (this is called the **strike price**), and even if the share price drops way below that Max promises to buy them regardless. That gives Bob peace of mind because now he knows that even if LOLI Corp goes south, he won't lose all his money because he can still sell his shares to Max and get at least that $1000 each for it, but he knows he has no obligation to sell if the doesn't want to.\n\nNow Max isn't an idiot, he knows that even though he's confident in the market and LOLI Corp, if for whatever reason the price does plummet anyway, he's going to lose money. He will have to keep his promise to buy a share for $1000 off Bob even though in the pit the share worth way less. To offset that risk, Max is adding some stipulations to his promise: (1) he adds an expiration date so that this promise is only good for a limited time, and (2) this promise isn't free. After all, Max wants to be compensated for taking on this extra risk. Each promise to buy 1 share is going to cost Bob $10. If Bob has 10 shares, he's have to spend 10 x $10 to cover his ass. Bob knows this is a nice chunk of change, but the peace of mind is worth it to him, and compared to potentially losing everything, paying $100 isn't a bad deal. **THIS IS A PUT OPTION**. \n\nIt's called option, because it gives Bob the **option** (the right, but not the obligation) to sell at a certain price (the **strike price**) within a certain period (until the **expiration date**). \n\n***\n\nNow consider another parent, Sally. Sally heard about this whole LOLI Corp trading business and is curious about it but isn't quite sure if she should get in on the action. She thinks it could be pretty profitable, but she's pretty short on money right now and can't afford to dump a couple thousand bucks into a playground venture. Sally is pretty smart though, and she sees a lot of potential for the market and where things are headed with LOLI Corp. She knows the kid who's running it and everything so she thinks this whole thing is going places. If only she had the money to invest!\n\nMax, our savvy broker hears about her too and has an idea, what if he made a promise to Sally similar to the one he made to Bob. He promised Bob he would buy his shares for a certain price (if Bob wants to), but what stops Max from promising Sally to *sell* her LOLI Corp shares for a certain price? That way she'd get a share that's worth a ton for a really cheap price. It would be instant profit for Sally.\n\nMax is contemplating the potential outcomes. In the put option he sold to Bob, the worst case scenario is that the shares are literally worth nothing anymore ($0) and he still has to give Bob $1000 for them each. That's a potential loss of $990 per share! (Max makes $10 for selling the option, but then has to spend $1000 to buy worthless shares off Bob = $10 - $1000 = **-$990**). That would suck balls but it's not the end of the world.\n\nNow Sally's case is a whole other beast though. If Max promised to sell Sally shares of LOLI Corp for $1200 for example, but the price has risen to $5000 a share, he's looking at a potential loss of several thousand bucks per share (He'd have to buy a share in the pit for $5000, and then he'd have to sell it to Sally for $1200 = -$5000 + $1200 = **-$3800**). What if the price goes even higher? There's no upper limit how how high it can go and the higher it goes the more it hoses Max. Sounds pretty damn risky so Max is willing to do it, but he's going to charge way more for this promise. For $80, Max promises to give Sally the option to buy one share at a price of $1200 from him, but only until the expiration date. **THIS IS A CALL OPTION**. It gives Sally the right but not the obligation to buy shares at a certain price (**strike price**) within a certain period (until the **expiration date**)\n\nThis is great news for Sally! If she buys options for 10 shares, she has to spend only $800 (10 x $80). If the share price now rises to $1500, her options are **in the money**. She could decide to exercise her options and buy shares off Max for only $1200 and then turn around and sell them in the Pit for $1500. That would net her an instant $300 per share. Since she bought 10 options, she can do this 10 times for a net profit of 10 x -$80 + 10 x $300 = $2200 instant cash.\n\n***\n\nOptions have a ton of uses other than the ones illustrated here. These are the most basic ones, but you can do all kinds of funky stuff if you combine buying options and selling options, holding or shorting stocks etc. Most people use options to hedge their positions though or to speculate on a share price without having to shell out the money to buy the share itself.\n\nOptions are **derivatives** because as you can see in the example above, their value is *derived* from an **underlying** security  such as a stock or a bond for example. It's the price of the underlying that determines if the option is making the holder money (the option \"is in the money\") or losing the holder money (the option is \"out of the money\").\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for the gold! \ud83d\ude0a glad you guys found this useful",

        "body": "Imagine you had a business selling lollipops at school. Since you can buy a bag of 100 for $10, you can sell them for 25\u00a2 a piece for a profit. \n\nBut you don't have $10. But there is profit to be made for all if people give you the money. So you ask your friends to **invest**. They each give you $1 and you give them (and yourself) some **stock** in the **venture** - a promise to split the profit. You guys buy a bag, and in one week, you sell all your lollipops for 25\u00a2 each. \n\nSo now you have 0 lollipops and\n25\u00a2 x 100 = $25\nAwesome! \nMaybe you pay yourself a market rate for your job in the venture as salesman (you're also an employee since you sold the pops) - say $5\nSo you have $20 to split 10 ways. Everybody makes $2 from their $1 investment - everybody wins. you could pay them back their $1 investment and another $1 profit - this extra is called a **dividend**. \n\nNow, would your investors go in again next week? Sure! You're doubling their money. And you ran out of lollipops right? So maybe get everyone together to vote and we all agree at a **shareholder meeting** to skip the dividend and turn the venture into a **business** that reinvests the profit into 2 bags of lollipops and make money even faster. \n\nNext week you sell out again. Since you're just one sales guy, you still only cost $5 and your **profit margin** has risen. You can now buy 4.5 bags of lollipops each week. Your business is growing! \n\nNow the new kid in school has noticed your business and he wants to buy a share. You **sold** a share to your friends for $1. But now each week, thay share grew in the potential value of its dividend. So how much should a share cost today? Even though the investors haven't actually gotten money back on the business, the share they own has grown in value as the business has grown. \n\nWell one of your old friends wants to buy a comic book that costs $5 and he has no allowance because he spent all his money buying his share the first week. He's ready to start making money back but the stockholders want to keep reinvesting the dividends. So some of the shareholders and the new kid, Martin get together on the playground and start talking. Comic book kid says is willing to sell his share. So he **asks** for $5 from Martin. But Martin doesn't want to pay that. So Martin **bids** $4.50.  There is now a **bid-ask spread of .50\u00a2** - meaning it's less likely for a sale to happen then if that spread was $0 and more likely than if the spread was $1. The stock might not actually sell today because the market is slow and sticky rather than **liquid**. The stock in the company is **illiquid**.\n\nSome more kids gather around. They're hip. They want to grow their lunch money. So they **bid** $4.75.,$4.85, $4.95 - **sold** comic book kid thinks this is close enough and a transaction happens. The market is gaining **liquidity** as more buyers and sellers gain interest.\n\n\nBut now Martin's got hella-bad FOMO (fear of missing out). He offers $5.10 to buy it from the new owner. Seeing the **stock price** rise, other owners consider selling. They consider **holding**. They consider buying more. All start negotiating. Some kids call their parents and ask for an advance on their allowance. Some  parent hear about this crazy business that doubles each week and they tell the kid to act as a **broker** on the trading floor and do the deal on the parent's behalf. Baby, you've got yourself a stock pit. \n\n\n## Waaaaaaahhhh!!! Okay, okay Part II\n**Market, Limit, Stop orders; Futures contracts; Options; Shorting; Insider trading, and market manipulation**\n\nNone of this stuff affects the **profit** of the company. The stock was sold in the **initial public (school) offering** (IPO). And since then, the company itself has just sold lollipops and reinvested in growth. But if they want to grow more they can get all the shareholders together and vote to sell more shares. This **dilutes** the existing shareholders, but if it helps grow the company, the stock price will go up and it means a smaller slice of a bigger pie - so they decide to do it. They **issue more shares**.\n\nSo Lollipop Co. (ticker: LOLI) is booming. I mean, it basically doubles every week so people want more stock. And neighborhood adults and local business owners want to grow their money. So they head over to the playground and ask the teachers if they can get in to buy some stock. The teacher are like, \"Um... no you can't go on the playground, you don't go to this school and you're an adult, perv. So the local adults pass notes to the kids to buy stock on their behalf and have the kids **broker** a deal. But the price different people will sell for keeps moving so the kid asks, \"what price are you willing to buy it at?\" And the parent (client) can say:\n- place a **limit order** - I'll only pay up to $6.50 and if it moves past that before you can find a seller, cancel it \n- place a **market order** - I'll buy it at any price you can get it for over the next hour or so. \n- place a **stop order** - for some reason I only want to buy above a certain price. Probably because if it is moving down in price I think it will keep moving down. \n\nThese purchases are getting complicated and kids don't want to work for free. Adults (institutional investors) have *a lot* of money compared to kids. Each aggressive purchase makes the stock price move up. \n The broker kids get paid a fee - maybe 25\u00a2. But the adults are buying like $1000 in stock at a time. So a really clever kid, Max, decides to start buying LOLI when his adult does. Since the stock price was like $7, if an adult wants to buy 1000 shares, the price has to move up as he asks kid after kid after kid to sell all his shares. He knows this means the stock price will get higher and higher - so he personally buys as much as he can before he starts trading for his adult. He has invented **frontrunning**. \n\nTeachers see this and get upset because frontrunning drives the price of the stock up for neighborhood adults unfairly and those adults are the tax payers that pay the teacher's salary. So they declare frontrunning against the rules. \n\nMeanwhile, as the CEO and sole employee (I guess) of Lollico. you know the weekly sales figures before anyone else. You could **manipulate** the market price by leaking information about it. You can say the sales are low, then buy up stock and say - \"psych\" (do kids still say psych?) and watch the price rise. Teachers hate this too because again it makes the taxpaying adults mad. So they say its against the rules and call it **market manipulation** - specifically it is **misreporting financials** and **insider trading**. The opposite is **pump and dump**.  So now you need to file a record of your sales and expenses with the Special Educational Council or **SEC** (securities and exchange commission - a stock is also called a security for some reason) that ensures everybody is following the rules. \n\nMax - recently released from timeout - has another brilliant idea. LOLI is now at $4,555 because of all the adults who have bought in. This time, he thinks that this whole LOLI thing is way oversold. He thinks the stock isn't worth what the market says because Max actually read my ELI5 and understands that fundamentally, the stock is worth what **dividends** it can pay you and there aren't enough kids at this school to buy millions of dollars of lollipops. Max wants to bet against the price of the stock going up. He can do this a few ways. One way is to \"borrow\" a stock from some adults. So Max, while he doesn't own the stock, has borrowed it from an adult (as a loan for a small interest rate called **security lending**) and sold it for less (**short**) than what it might be worth at the immediate current price. He now has a bunch of borrowed cash - $4,555 and owes one share of LOLI in 30 days back to the lender. If the price moves up, he will owe a lot of money to those adults in order to buy back the stock at a higher price. Potentially infinite money if the price keeps climbing and he can't buy it. Shorting is dangerous - but Max likes to live dangerously. He shorts the stock and then goes around asking kids if they've ever gotten a dividend. No one seems to understand what a dividend is - it has been like a whole month since LOLI went public (school) and everyone forgot. Max explains why stocks have value and all of a sudden everyone freaks out and starts selling before their stock is worthless. The stock tumbles down to $15 where he is easily able to buy it before paying back his adult lender and Max pockets the $4,540 difference. He's basically the only one who made mad lunch money at this point.\n\nBut the company is fine - they're still selling lollipops. \n\n\n\n",

People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the 172. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Mundane, maybe. Even boring at times. But there was one day in our Cessna experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be some of the slowest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\nIt occurred when my CFI and I were flying a training flight. We needed 40 hours in the plane to complete my training and attain PPL status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the 40 hour mark. We had made the turn back towards our home airport in a radius of a mile or two and the plane was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the left seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because I would soon be flying as a true pilot, but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Bumbling across the mountains 3,500 feet below us, I could only see the about 8 miles across the ground. I was, finally, after many humbling months of training and study, ahead of the plane.\n\nI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for my CFI in the right seat. There he was, with nothing to do except watch me and monitor two different radios. This wasn't really good practice for him at all. He'd been doing it for years. It had been difficult for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my this part of my flying career, I could handle it on my own. But it was part of the division of duties on this flight and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. My CFI was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding awkward on the radios, a skill that had been roughly sharpened with years of listening to LiveATC.com where the slightest radio miscue was a daily occurrence. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\nJust to get a sense of what my CFI had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Denver Center, not far below us, controlling daily traffic in our sector. While they had us on their scope (for a good while, I might add), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to ascend into their airspace.\n\nWe listened as the shaky voice of a lone SR-71 pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied:\"Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.\"\n\nNow the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \" Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.\n\nJust moments after the SR-71's inquiry, an F-18 piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. \"Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.\" Boy, I thought, the F-18 really must think he is dazzling his SR-71 brethren. Then out of the blue, a Twin Beech pilot out of an airport outside of Denver came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Twin Beech driver because he sounded very cool on the radios. \"Center, Beechcraft 173-Delta-Charlie ground speed check\". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, that Beech probably has a ground speed indicator in that multi-thousand-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Delta-Charlie here is making sure that every military jock from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the slowest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new bug-smasher. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"173-Delta-Charlie, Center, we have you at 90 knots on the ground.\"\n\nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that my CFI was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere minutes we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Beechcraft must die, and die now. I thought about all of my training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\nSomewhere, half a mile above Colorado, there was a pilot screaming inside his head. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the right seat. That was the very moment that I knew my CFI and I had become a lifelong friends. Very professionally, and with no emotion, my CFI spoke: \"Denver Center, Cessna 56-November-Sierra, can you give us a ground speed check?\" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. \"Cessna 56-November-Sierra, I show you at 76 knots, across the ground.\"\n\nI think it was the six knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that my CFI and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most CFI-like voice: \"Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to 72 on the money.\"\n\nFor a moment my CFI was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when Denver came back with, \"Roger that November-Sierra, your E6B is probably more accurate than our state-of-the-art radar. You boys have a good one.\"\n\nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable stroll across the west, the Navy had been owned, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Slow, and more importantly, my CFI and I had crossed the threshold of being BFFs. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to our home airport.\n\nFor just one day, it truly was fun being the slowest guys out there.",

        "body": "The most effective way to weight loss is to reduce calorie intake. You can\u2019t outrun a bad diet. Be prepared that it takes as much time to lose the extra weight as it took for you to put it on. Losing weight too fast will also not have the desired result (loose skin, reduced muscle mass, fatigue).\n\nI\u2019ve been where you are now. My height is 185cm, I weighed 72 kg when I was 18 years old, and I was 110kg at my heaviest. I weigh 76kg now. Physical exercise is good, but does not make a meaningful impact as weight loss is concerned. It has to come from changing your eating habits.\n\nIdeal weight for someone your height is between 72 and 77kg. Right now, at 105kg, you need to consume 2500 kcal just to stay the same weight. That\u2019s a lot of food. The upside: there is a lot of room for you to eat less.\n\nTo lose one kilogram per week (doing more is not advisable), you will need to reduce your energy intake by 700 kcal per day. That still leaves 1800 kcal per day, you can definitely eat three meals a day and not feel hungry.\n\nNot feeling hungry while losing weight comes down to diet choices. Here are a few pointers to reducing your energy intake without feeling hungry:\n\n* No alcoholic beverages (rich in calories, messes with your metabolism, makes you hungry)\n* No fruit juices or soft drinks (drink water instead)\n* Less sugar (lots of calories) and salt (makes you thirsty)\n* Cut back on fatty foods (1g of fat is 7 kcal, 100g of butter\/ghee\/oil is 700 kcal), no (deep)fried foods like pakora\n* Eat more protein (whey protein shakes, eggs, milk, yogurt, cheese, soya, chole, chana dal, palak, matar)\n* Stay away from simple starches like potatoes, white rice, and white flower (maida). Eat fewer chapati and less rice in general.\n* Eat more greens (methi, sarson da saag, palak, hari gobi, etc.)\n* Eat more pulses (rajma, chana, chole, etc.)\n* No snacks in between meals \u2013 potato chips, biscuits, chocolate, candy, etc\n\nIn order to understand what you\u2019re eating and what the caloric value of those foods are, log everything in [MyFitnessPal](http:\/\/www.myfitnesspal.com). The account is completely free, just be honest and disciplined in inputting everything you eat and drink. If you don\u2019t have a good scale, get one. Weigh yourself in the morning, 20 minutes after you wake up, after you\u2019ve peed, then log your weight in MyFitnessPal. Weight fluctuates all through the day and from day to day. Don\u2019t worry about the readings from day to day \u2013 if you are consuming fewer calories, you will soon start to see a downward line in MyFitnessPal. Most importantly: stay at it, and adjust where necessary.\n\n1kg weight loss per week is quite feasible. If you start now, you can be under 90kg in 3,5 months. By summer, you could be back to your old weight of 75kg. Good luck! If you need any help, feel free to send me a PM.",

        "body": "I posted this comment a while back, and it seems relevant here...\n\n***\n\nShips used to have their rudders afixed to the right side, and this was the side they steered from. 'Starboard' is a corruption of 'steorbord' or 'steer-board.'  In fact, the word 'steer' comes from the Old Norse 'st\u00fdri' meaning rudder.\n\nWhen pulling into port, ships approached with the land on their left side to avoid damaging the rudder. This is why that side is called 'port side.'  It was originally called 'larboard,' derived from 'load-board' (the side you load cargo on), but they decided that the term sounded too similar to 'starboard' and changed it.\n\nWhen two ships crossed paths, the one on the right side had the right-of-way (hence the name).  Since ships often passed in the dark of night, they needed a way to determine the location and orientation of other vessels.  So, they afixed a red light to left (port) side and a green light to the right (starboard) side.\n\nIf the red light of the other ship was visible, it meant that their left side was facing you, thus they were on the right, and that you should yield to them.  If their green light was visible, then you were the one with the right-of-way.  This is where we get our modern traffic signal colors: red means stop and green means go.  This same color system is still used today on aircraft--look next time you see one [fly over at night](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hHIt1dw.jpg).\n\nIf you have trouble keeping it all straight, remember that *port* wine is *red*, and that there's never any *left* in the morning.  Incidentally, port wine is named after the **Port**uguese seaport city of **Port**o, from which it was originally ex**port**ed.  All three of those uses of port that I just boldfaced are derived from the Latin word '*portus*' meaning 'harbor.'\n\nOf course, port wine isn't the alcoholic beverage most closely tied to the sea.  For that honor, look to akvavit (sometimes called 'aquavit' in English-speaking countries).  The name is derived from the Latin *aqua vitae* meaning 'water of life.'  Norwegians produce a particularly unique variety, called Linie Aquavits. It was traditionally put in barrels and strapped to the sides of ships for transport.  This exposure to the sea gives it a unique briny flavor.  Today, they still send it to Australia and back just to give it that flavor.\n\nAs long as we're hanging out at the water level on the side of an old ship, here's an interesting fact about the phrase, \"there's the devil to pay.\"  On old ships, they made them water-tight by caulking the cracks with oakum--a mixture of plant fiber and pitch.  Caulking a seam in the boards was known as 'paying' the seam.  The lowest seam--the one right over the water--was the most dangerous.  Sailors had to hang off the side of the ship from ropes, and when they got right down to the water, there was a chance of being swept off.  For this reason, the lowest seam was known as the Devil's seam.   It it was your job to caulk it, then there was \"the devil to pay.\"\n\nAs much as I'd like to say that's the origin of the phrase, it's not. The first use predates nautical terms by a century; sailors just lifted the term and reused it.  The degree to which it was contrived is unknown.\n\nHowever, a phrase that does have true nautical origins is \"three sheets to the wind,\" referring to a drunk person.  While you might think that 'sheet' refers to a sail, it actually refers to ropes.  Three of these restrained the sails on a fully-masted large ship.  If all three were loose, the sails were fully in the wind, and the ship haphazardly rolled around, like a drunk person does while walking down the sidewalk.\n\nSimilarly, the bottom corner of a sail is called the 'foot.'  If the foot is let loose, the sail dances around in the wind.  It's footloose!\n\nKevin Bacon starred in the movie Footloose, and you're probably familiar with the \"six degrees of Kevin Bacon\" system.  The idea, in case anyone is unfamiliar, is that Kevin Bacon has been in so many things that you can classify actors by how many 'degrees removed' from Kevin Bacon they are.  (e.g. Susie was in a movie with Joe, who was in a movie with Tommy, who was in a movie with Kevin Bacon...three degrees).\n\nLess commonly-known is the 'Erd\u0151s number,' named after mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s.  He co-authored so damn many academic papers that you can link most other authors to him by degrees.\n\nWhat's *really* cool is that a small number of people have both been in a movie and published an academic paper, giving them a combined **Erd\u0151s\u2013Bacon** number.  For example, actress Natalie Portman has an Erd\u0151s\u2013Bacon number of 7.  In fact, she's quite accomplished academically.  She missed the red-carpet premier of Phantom Menace to study for finals.\n\nThe surname '*Port*man' is also derived from the Latin *portus*. A 'portman' loaded ships.",

In my efforts I've tried to get some interactive code going for eventual use in a very basic GUI but I feel constrained by the \"fuzziness\" of R coding. Simply trying to create a function to plot based on user input ran me into some advanced concepts pretty quickly. R has environments, dynamic scoping, non-standard evaluation, all very complicated concepts and I don't remember them being present in the small amounts of coding I've done in Java\/Python. Am I right in thinking a language with a more OOP design would be better for this task of automatically generating charts\/visualizations?

        "body": "Made an alt for this. Too many friends browse Randia. \n\nI've been in two relationships and both changed me. \n\nI'm 25 now. I got into my first relationship as a horny 16-year-old with another horny 16 year old who wanted nothing but to have sex. Except, in my foolishness, I believed it was true love. So when I found out that she was sleeping with 4 different men, often 4 to 8 years older than her, I fell into a deep spell of depression, the pangs of which I still feel today. The reveal also made me examine my existing relationship with her only to finally understand that I was a doormat, someone she used when she wanted to fuck, someone who took me for granted and emotionally abused me. It completely wrecked me, I used to be a meek boy who was just interested in video games back then, and I had turned into a chainsmoking drunk by the time I was 20. It took me 5 long years to finally rid myself of her, and in the last 10 years, that was the second happiest moment of my life - that sense of freedom. Having dropped off the weight you were carrying for so long and looking up to the sky. I wanted to scream, I cried with happiness, the nightmare was over. I told myself I'll never get into another relationship again. \n\nA couple of years later, the woman who would be my second girlfriend walked into my life, literally straight into my bedroom. She was a friend of a close friend, and my friend had brought her along over to my house to hang out. This was in 2014, by this time, I put on a tremendous amount of weight and -while my alcohol consumption had gone down - was still a chain smoker. No woman in her right mind would have looked at me twice, and I wanted it to stay that way because I believed I was atoning for the sheer stupidity of trusting my first girlfriend and being stupid enough to fall for her mind games. \n\nBut this woman, she was different. The connection was instantaneous, I found myself being flirty once again, I was making her laugh, my friend told me in private later that she adored that first meeting. We spent the day together, going around town, and by evening I had asked her out. \n\nIt was sheer madness, I had only just met her in the morning, and here I was asking her out against my better judgement. I don't know who was taking a bigger risk, her by trusting a guy she had just met on that day, or me, giving my heart away to another woman, despite not having fully recovered from the depression I was in. \n\nThe next couple of years were some of the best times in my life. She was...she understood, you know? She understood what I was going through and she did not judge me for it. She was there when I was going through some of the worst times in my life, professionally. She was there in my happiest moments, something that would never happen, or so I had convinced myself to believe. \n\nEventually, I had to move to a different city to work, and she had to leave the country for a job. The distance put tremendous amount of strain on our relationship. The connection we had when we were together was gone, it was replaced by a screen and a few lines of text. Even on phone calls, we pined for each other, and I couldn't share what I was going through over text or phone because I didn't know what to say, I wanted to tell her everything in person. I just couldn't do it over the phone. \n\nMy episodes of depression returned, we would go days, even weeks without talking to each other. It took a heavy toll. \n\nBy December of 2015, we hadn't spoken to each other in a few weeks, except the occasional bits of text, the kind that doesn't actually count as an actual conversation. I was miserable, I hated every couple I saw in public places. Then it was the night before my birthday, it's just about midnight and we're returning from watching Star Wars in theaters when a car shows up and out pops her. All the way from the country she was working in just for my birthday. \n\nI've been an atheist for some time now, but at that moment I could think of no one else but God. Nothing else could explain what I was seeing, right? She didn't even tell me she was coming back, she just showed up out of the blue and I'm at a loss for words, surrounded by friends and family - all of whom knew about the plan in advance. Attempts to talk resulted in a weird noise escaping my throat, there simply were no words, so I went up and hugged her. \n\nIt was the happiest day of my life. \n\nDespite this, however, things continued to deteriorate between us. We broke up 6 months later because there was no logical way to continue the relationship anymore. We both wanted each other to be around, and expect either of us to drop everything and come running would be selfish.  \n\nAfter the breakup, I realised that something had snapped in me. I was no longer interested in dating, she had ruined everyone else for me. I quit smoking a month after the breakup, it's been a year and a half now since my last cigarette. I also quit alcohol, and eventually joined a gym and have been steadily working on getting fit and being the best version of myself. I'm down to 110 KG from 140, and I've got 30 more to go, which I'll probably finish by June next year. \n\nI know it's a long sob story, but I've been carrying this around with me for a long time and never really had the opportunity to speak about it. My first ex-turned me into the person I am today, and my second ex fine-tuned the person I had become to be more confident, to be kinder to myself, to trust in people and to not shut myself away from the world. If it wasn't for her, I would still probably be lamenting my shitty job, today I work the job I've always wanted to after quitting late last year. \n\nI do miss being in a relationship, that intimacy you have with your partner, the inside jokes, the non-verbal understanding, the cuddles and watching your favourite movies together and explaining to her why Lord of the Rings is the greatest thing since sliced bread. But I realise now that I need to love myself too before I can present myself to be loved by someone else. Expecting someone to love me when I hate myself is being unfair to the person I'll be in a relationship with. \n\nOkay, I've rambled on for a bit and I don't know how to conclude this. But I'll just say this, I don't feel the need to be in a relationship anymore, I'm now focusing full time on my career, and I'm happy. \n\nTL;DR: First Ex ruined mental health, second ex fixed me like the Coldplay song.

        "body": "After my rant on why its hard to hire for CS, received around 15 PMs asking for advice. Since all these PMs had similar questions and I'm sure many others have similar questions but didn't PM, I'm consolidating them in here. So my thoughts on how candidates should go about getting hired\n\n**My college sucks. I\u2019ll be graduating in a year or two. What to do? What should I learn? What project should I do?**\n\nFirstly, I'll just give a brief rundown of where I see the IT industry heading over the next 5-10 years. I think the 3 safest areas to build your career around are Android, iOS and Javascript. \n\nI do not see any other mobile OS breaking the dominance of Android or iOS in the next 10 years - the mobile OS wars are over and we are heading into the territory where Windows and OS X are now for the desktop. So learning Java\/Android and Swift\/iOS are safe bets. I do not see cross platform toolkits (Ionic, Xamarin etc) expanding beyond a niche so you don't need to worry about them. \n\nFor web based apps, Javascript will always be evergreen since it is impossible for browsers to change the HTML\/CSS\/JS paradigm. And even for serverside, it looks like Node.js (a web framework written in Javascript) will beat out Ruby on Rails (web framework written in Ruby) and Django (a web framework written in Python) eventually. However it isn't clear who'll win the client side framework wars (React? Vue? Angular? Some new framework?) so this is a tricky part. However, client side frameworks are fairly simple and learning one should provide a roadmap to learning all others.\n\nMy recommendation - pick either Javascript (Node.js + one of React\/Vue\/Angular) or Android\/Java or iOS\/Swift. Keep in mind though that Android\/Java and iOS\/Swift are more likely to be popular in consumer apps while Javascript (web apps) are more likely to be popular in business apps. Business apps generally quietly make lots and lots and lots of money but consumer apps are more fun to work on. Choose wisely. \n\nNow you've picked one - what project to do? Pick a hobby you have - music? photography? fitness?. *Make something that you will use everyday in this hobby*. For example, if fitness is your hobby then you can make a fitness goal tracking app. Divide the project into different levels of progression. Level one can be a simple way to log your workouts. Level two can be adding user profiles so you can see your friends workouts. Level three can be adding GPS tracking. Level four can be adding tracking diet. And so on. By the time you go for an interview, this project with all its different modules will be like your baby and you'll be able to spend hours talking about it.\n\nIts important to pick a project where the app you'll build is something you will use. You'll never use a library management system or restaurant order management system so there is no point building these types of apps even though they most commonly show up when you search for \"app ideas\".\n\n**<Insert Story of Company Recruitment Being Terrible\/Time in Company Being Terrible>. Can you recommend me good companies?**\n\nThis is tricky. Sometimes, especially in big companies, they can be both great and terrible at the same time - because its your manager who usually sets the experience in the company. I can't really recommend but I can give some steps for finding ones. Firstly do not subscribe to cliches like that MNCs = evil, crappy work and startups = force of good, exciting work or Indian companies = all suck, crappy and US companies = amazing, high quality work. They are plenty of well run, great MNCs and plenty of terrible startups and well run Indian companies and crappy US companies . \n\nHere you'll have to put aside your programming skills and work on your social engineering skills. First, try and identify who'll be your manager. Ask your interviewers who'll be your manager after you are selected. Try and read up on him, web, his blogs, Linkedin etc. Try and see if can use your web stalking skills to find some ex-employees of him. Take them out for coffee or beer and try and get a sense of how they feel like their manager it. It might sound like too much work but its better than spending a year in hell counting down the days to when you can get your job and and move on from your nightmare of a manager.\n\n**Certifications? Yay or nay?**\n\n**NAY NAY NAY A HUNDRED TIMES NAY**. I can't believe we are still asking this question. I have yet to see a certification that actually was helpful. The only companies that seem to care about certifications are the ones that issue them themselves e.g. Cisco. \n\n**Time gap, failed papers, no degree, marks too low or something else negative. What to do?**\n\nThere is little you can do about it. A company will ever have a policy on it (e.g. not hire people without graduate degrees or with supplies) and there is nothing you can do about it OR they will not have a policy on it in which they will almost always hire you if you are good enough since there is a shortage of good CS engineers and all companies are desperate. Just make up some story to explain all these - family could not afford, medical reasons, family emergency etc a bit of white lies is better in this case than brutal honesty (I decided to just play video games all semester).\n\n**Can I work with you?**\n\nI should have written the rant 3 years ago when I was still recruiting :). Unfortunately, about 2 years ago I decided to just keep my business on autopilot mode. This meant transiting out of full time employees to short term contractors. I little over 30 now - have sufficient savings from both working in USA and from my business and will eventually sell my business in 1-2 years so I have no financial urgency to work for the next couple of years. So, I am just taking it easy mostly these days, trying to think of what new adventures await and shitposting on Randia =). ",

        "body": "**Edit:** I've posted this before. It was not my intention to deceive anyone. Also, I feel like I should clear something up. I think addiction is 50% genetics, and 50% environmental factors that played a role in shaping the individual up until the drug abuse. That's kind of what I meant by it. I'm not saying *everyone* is born an addict, I'm saying that some people are predisposed to becoming addicts. [Here](http:\/\/www.addictscience.com\/are-some-people-born-addicts\/) is some more info if you'd care to get a better understanding.\n\nAlso, I'm 23. Sorry for the confusion.\n\nI'd like to add my own thoughts on this, as a recovering Heroin addict.\n\n\nAs much as people want to think of the world as black and white; right and wrong, do or don't, it's much more nuanced than that. The best way I can describe it is a steady succession of bad choices over a period of time, brought on by life events. I am of the firm belief that an individual is born an addict. Your brain is just waiting for the right stimulant to manifest the addiction. For a lot of people, it's alcohol. Others, it's stimulants. The first time I tried opioids was when I was fifteen (I'm twenty-three now). \n\nIn American Psycho, Brett Easton Ellis writes a line that truly defines addiction for me. He writes, \"Relief washes over me like an awesome wave\". When I took opiates, from the moment I first felt the effects, I knew they would ultimately be a problem.\n\n\nSo, trying them sporadically over the next few years, I first started abusing them after a four-year relationship ended. You tell yourself, \"Oh I'll just buy some for tomorrow and then I'll wait a week\". That turns into, \"I'll do pills, but I'll never try heroin; that's for junkies. I'm above that. I'm refined.\" Which turns into, \"Well Heroin is so much cheaper than pills, so I'll buy that. But I'll only smoke it. Shooting it in your veins is for the hardcore users. I'm above that. I'm refined.\" Which turns into, \"Well I can sit there and smoke $20 worth of heroin in one sitting, or I can shoot $5 worth into my veins, and piece it out four times.\" I'll tell you right now. The high from putting junk in your veins compared to even smoking it is absolutely incomparable. You know the beginning scene of Trainspotting when Renton has the tie around his arm, cigarette dangling out of his mouth, and his eyes are rolled into the back of his skull? He says, \"Take the best orgasm you've ever had, multiply it by a thousand, and you're still no where near the feel of a hit in your veins.\" That's the best description I could ever hope to actualize.\n\n\nNo one will truly understand the things that we users will do in order to get our next hit. Being dope sick is literally the worst pain I have ever been in in my entire life. When people think of pain, they think of acute, and visceral pain. Being dope sick is acutely painful, as well as having a psychological skull-fuck on the user. The feeling of sitting by my phone, waiting for my dealer to wake the fuck up from his inevitable hit-inducing four-hour coma; having a text come in from someone who is not your d-boy (the ONLY person you want anything to do with in the entire world at that moment) and screaming at your phone, launching it across your room. The feeling of your dealer saying that he'll be at the spot in ten minutes, and him not showing up for a fucking hour, while you sit in your car slamming your hands against the steering wheel, skin crawling and sweat drip down your brow.\n\n\nIt's indescribable. But hey. When you get that hit in you, it's all worth it. It's like you learned nothing from the past four hours. From the past week. From the past however-long. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, and expecting different results; somehow thinking that the experience will be different from the last.\n\n\nI've seen my dad cry twice in my life. Once when his brother was in the hospital, and the other is when I woke up from my heroin overdose in the hospital with tubes down my throat. I'm 23 years old, and seeing my dad cry kind of broke me even more. I hope you can find peace, and I encourage you to PM me if you ever want to talk.\n\n\nI wouldn't wish addiction on my worst enemy. I hope that explanation at least scratches the surface. I'm eight months sober. I was ten months sober, but I had a very brief relapse. If anyone has questions, again, feel free to ask.",

        "body": "Hey all, let's talk. No, it's not like that. We aren't angry, we're just disappointed.\n\nLet's take a gander at this subreddit real quick. Check out that sidebar. Mmm. Look at that fucking header. Classy. You see that title? \"how to not give a fuck\". Poetry. \n\nNotice how it doesn't say \"fix my life for me\" or \"make me feel better\" or \"solve my problems because I don't know how\"? There's a reason for that.\n\nThis isn't \/r\/relationship_advice or \/r\/mmfb . The point of this subreddit isn't to make you cheer up. \n\nLet's take a tangent here. It's important; I promise. \n\nIt isn't our job to fix your life. \"But bikewithoutafish, this is \/r\/howtonotgiveafuck! You're supposed to teach us!\" Well, dearest child, yes and no. See, the thing is, this is your life. Yours. You, my sweet little angel, have been given a wonderful gift of being able to be alive, to feel, to love, to hate, and to understand (to some degree) the world around us and inside us. This life is your life, light of my soul.\n\nIf you aren't mature enough to make an effort to control your life, and instead turn to some strangers online to fix all of your problems instantly and painlessly by posting here you have bigger issues than learning to not give a fuck. You need to grow up. \n\nNow, shit gets meta here. This is an issue of both content and character. No one wants to wade through hundreds of posts about how she broke your heart or how you will never get with him or whatever. That's boring and sophomoric. That makes this subreddit a worse place for everyone. \n\nBUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, if your response to these relationship issues, and others, is to post about it online to get our sagely wisdom, there is an underlying issue with you. You're not giving right fucks.\n\nSee, to me, giving fucks is a virtue. It's like the Eightfold path in Buddhism. Let's use an example to illustrate this. One of the parts of the Eightfold path is \"Right Speech\", namely \"Right speech, explained in negative terms, means avoiding four types of harmful speech: lies (words spoken with the intent of misrepresenting the truth); divisive speech (spoken with the intent of creating rifts between people); harsh speech (spoken with the intent of hurting another person's feelings); and idle chatter (spoken with no purposeful intent at all).\" (http:\/\/www.accesstoinsight.org\/lib\/authors\/thanissaro\/speech.html)\n\nNotice this doesn't say \"Don't ever talk, because language is inadequate and harmful\", or some shit, it basically boils down to \"Don't be an asshole. Say what you mean, mean what you say. Use common sense. Don't lie\".\n\nGiving fucks is like the ninth part of the path. Give right fucks. That's what we mean when we say to not give a fuck. If you gave literally no fucks you would be a heroin junkie or a protozoan ooze that never leaves your couch. That's not a good life.\n\nBut on the other hand, we aren't your babysitters. It takes two people to learn: one to teach, and the other to listen.\n\nYOU have to make an effort to better yourself. \nYOU are responsible for your own life. \nYOU have to be prepared to learn, and come here with something to bring to the table, instead of a post that just pleads for our advice about your shitty ex-girlfriend.\n\nAnd, as a community\n\nWE have to be prepared to help those who will help themselves;  \nWE have to be able to give advice on matters, regardless of how banal or dumb they are IF they are offered earnestly and with the intention of self-betterment;  \nWE have to be dedicated to creating a community in which discussion and wisdom can flourish, together.\n\nSo, I'll quit rambling now.\n\nHenceforth, all posts posts asking for relationship advice that do not show any initiative on the OP's behalf will be deleted and OP will be directed to \/r\/relationship_advice or a similar subreddit. If you are not prepared to make an effort BEFORE POSTING to make yourself better, we should not be expected to make an effort either.\n\nSimilar posts, ones that bring nothing to the table, will also be deleted, as per moderator discretion. \n\nThis is a wonderful place, and there can be a lot of learning here, guys. Just have some fucking common sense. \n\nHugs and kisses,\n\/u\/bikewithoutafish and the mods.\n\nP.S. Any questions or discussions about this change can be brought up on this post.\n\nTL;DR - If you seriously cannot make the effort to read such a small amount of text, please lock yourself in a dark room and think seriously about the direction your life is headed in.",

        "body": "When I was 15 years old, I ran away from home because I was pissed off at my parents for a reason I cant remember. I didnt have much money, so I decided to hop onto the skytrain(public transport train in British Columbia) and ride it as far as it would go. I reached the end of the line in less then an hour, and decided I wanted to ride it all the way back again, while trying to formulate some kind of plan of how I wanted to live the rest of my life without my parents or anyone.\nAt the last stop, or the first stop depending on your perspective of it, a girl came on and sat in the row right behind me. I didnt pay much attention to her at first, as I was busy writing my life plan on a napkin. It was a few minutes later that she got up and came sat next to me, curious as to what I was writing. I told her the story, and after a few laughs, we began talking about everything and anything. Her name was Amanda, 17 years old, and absolutely wonderful. She told me she was getting off at the last stop, which was also the first stop, depending on how you look at it. It was also the stop I had gotten on originally, and I told her we would ride to it together. The train ride took less then an hour, and what a wonderful hour indeed.\n\nWhen the last stop did come, we both knew we probably wouldnt see each other ever again(this was before the days of cellphones, and I was a shy little kid afraid to make moves). As we got to the end of the sidewalk which split in two different directions, she went right and I went left. Before saying goodbye she turned to me and asked me a question that has become a wonderful part of my life; she asked me, \u201cTell me something you have done, or want to do, that you think I should do? It can be anything, as challenging as you want it to be, or as easy. As long as you give me the rest of my life to complete it, I promise I will do it..\u201d I was confused as to why, but I thought about it, and told her, \u201cSing a song acapella in a room full of strangers.\u201d She said perfect and asked me if I would like a challenge as well. I told her I did, and she told me, \u201cread, from start to finish, \u201cUlysses\u201d by James Joyce.\u201d I had never heard of it at the time, but I agreed, and we said our goodbyes.\n\nI have a awful memory, and cant remember most conversations I have with most people. But I remember all of that clearly. You know why? Because of the challenge she gave me. In the 12 years that have past since, I have tried to read that book in over 150 different sittings. Everytime I open my copy of the 780 page monster of a book, I always think of her, and I always think of that day. Ive never been sure if it was her intent or not, but she left her lasting memory on me with that challenge. I soon after learned what she did, was a completey wonderful and amazing thing for me. So I decided to keep it going.\nIve met a lot of strangers in my life; some that have become friends, and some, due to living in different time zones and whatnot, didnt. I dont want to just have experiences and then let them go. I want to remember these meetings, and embrace the fact that they happened. So whenever I leave someone who has left an amazing impact of my life, I always make sure to add them to my Ulysses Bucket List. I ask them to give me a challenge, as difficult or as easy as they want it to be, and regardless of the fact that they have done it or not; simply something their heart has had wanted to do.\n\nSome have been easy and fun; I met a man in India 9 years ago who told me to, for a week or a month, cook\/buy twice as much food as I intend on eating, and give the other half to a stranger in need. I completed that mission 8 years ago, and thought about that man and the time we had all the way through. I met a girl on a cruise 6 years ago, who told me to jump into a body of water on a slightly cold day, without touching or feeling the temperature of the water first. I did that the very same year. I met a couple at an outdoor music festival a few years ago that told me to wear the most bizarre outfit imaginable and walk through a public place, completely oblivious to the fact that you arent looking normal. I did that task the very next day, at the same festival.\nSome have been difficult, to say the least: three guys I met in Amsterdam and smoked all night with, told me to go to a mall and give 10 strangers 10 presents. That one took a lot of courage, but I did it a year or so after I met them. It was nerve racking, but at the same time exhilerating leaving my comfort zone. A girl I met on a plane told me to sky dive; Im still in the process of getting that done. A couple I met in Cali on the beach told me to tell the 5 people I hated the most, that I love them and respect them. That one was very difficult because of my stubborness, but ive come close to completing that list many a times(still in the process, 2 more people to go).\n\nAnd some things, have had an everlasting impact on my daily life. I met a girl at a music festival, who told me that whenever I get mad at someone, walk away, sing my happy song in my head for 5 minutes, go back to the person im mad at with a clam heart and mind, and work things out. Ive made this my way of life. I once met a man at a gym in a hotel I was staying at, that told me \u201cwhenever your body and brain tells your that you are exhausted and done\u2026use your heart instead and push out 2 more reps.\u201d Ive made this my motto when working out or working on any kind of extrenuating exercise in which my body demands me to quit. I also use it while working on anything, and while studying. One of the best pieces of advice ive ever received.\n\nThere are many others that each brought joy to my life. There are still many tasks I have yet to accomplish, and everytime I think of these tasks, I think of the people that gave them to me. It amazes me how well I remember all these people, while I cant remember so many aspects of even yesterday. These experiences, not only do I take from them a \u201cmission\u201d or a \u201cchallenge\u201d, I also take from them a memory of them that never fails to appear inside of my mind.\nI opened my Ulysses book for probably the 300th time yesterday, and read a few pages, which prompted me to share this story with you today. Im in the final 30 pages of the book, also known as the most dreaded of the read(in the last 40 pages or so, James Joyce doesnt use a single punctuation mark; no periods, no commas, no nothing; a straight 50 page run-on sentence).\n\nI never saw Amanda after that day, nor do I know if she ever did get a chance to sing a song to a room full of strangers. But what I do know, is that she gave me a gift that has never once stopped giving. So wherever you may be, thank you for giving me the Ulysses Bucket List. And I swear i\u2019ll finish it one day. My life advice? Simple: Create your own Ulysses bucket list.\n\nEdit 1:fixed some spelling mistakes.  Going to leave 'clam' as is, haha!\n\nEdit 2: Ulyssesbucketlist subreddit is now a thing!\n\nEdit 3:  I'm trying to reply to all of your comments and give everyone who asks for their own challenge!  Please bare with me, I'll get to you I promise!\n\nEdit 4:  Monday 5\/19\/2014 UPDATE:  I'm kind of lacking words at the moment, and am in awe of the power of the universe.  Writing this story was just to relive a moment in my life, and to share it with others and maybe help them in some sort of way(or just give an entertaining story to read).  Never did I think there was the slightest chance I would actually get to talk to her again.  But thats exactly what happened.  Last night I found out that the Amanda that ThatGuyWhoAte knew, was in fact the Amanda I met 14 years ago.  Thank you Reddit.  From the bottom of my heart, I give to you the sincerest Thank You I can possibly give.  You gave me a chance to continue a life story that stopped writing 14 years ago.  I will never forget this. \n\nI talk a little bit more about it here:  http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Ulyssesbucketlist\/comments\/25yst9\/ulysses_bucket_list_amanda_update\/",

They are happy and very in love, but tragedy strikes; the boy gets drunk at a party, drives home with her, gets in an accident, and she is killed. He feels horrible, naturally.\n\nBut the girl isn't gone; she returns to the world as a ghost, not willing to pass on and be without her love. Unfortunately, he can neither see or hear her. She can whisper things in his ear and be perceived subconsciously, move small objects when he isn't looking, but never make her presence really known.\n\nFor a while she is content to simply follow him around and comfort him as best she can. It even seems she may be having a positive effect; she is able to subtly influence him to quit drinking, clean up his act, and turn his life around. All seems well in a bittersweet way.\n\nThings start to change as time passes. The boy gets older, the ghost does not. He starts to move past her death, no longer gazing longingly at the pictures of them together, not visiting her grave as much. While the ghost wants to see him happy, she is miserable that she is being forgotten, as she is unchanging and still feels love for him.\n\nA few years pass, and the now young adult man starts dating other women. The ghost is upset and jealous. She starts to sabotage his dates, causing little accidents, using her ability to be subconsciously heard to make him say awkward things, basically being a bitch and ruining the young man's relationships. \n\nUnable to find happiness, the young man begins to backslide. He starts drinking again, he gets in fights, he loses his job. His life is turning to shit. Ghost girl feels terrible...until one night the man takes too many sleeping pills and almost dies. A horrible plan occurs to her; if he commits suicide then he'll be dead too and they can finally be together.\n\nShe starts to egg him on to more and more self-destructive acts, whispering poisonous thoughts in his ear, trying to make him hate himself. He shuts out family and friends. He buys a gun and doesn't really know why. The girl hates to do this, but it's the only way...\n\nThroughout the film, we've seen other people haunted by ghosts. At first this seems harmless; there's a man whose father still follows him and gives advice. A mother who lost her daughter, but the girl still walks around holding her hand. The spirit of a young boy's dog still romps behind him. These ghosts can see each other, and are the typical Pixar cast of quirky side characters. \n\nAt last the young man seems to hit rock bottom and is ready to end it all. Not wanting to watch her love die, the ghost departs to leave him to it. She heads to the park, and sees some of the other people with ghosts. But now she notices things she hasn't before. The ghostly father's advice, always critical, seems downright abusive, constantly berating his son for his failure and inadequacy, and the son looks miserable. The little girl's mother can't look at a child playing without tearing up. The ghost dog is gone, however, and the now older boy has a new pet and is happy. The girl realizes that what she is doing is wrong.\n\nShe rushes back to the man, who is moments away from shooting himself. She begs him not to go through with it, pleads and cries, but is unheard. Eventually she is just barely able to direct his attention to the neglected photos of them together as happy teenagers and he puts the gun down, picks up the phone, and calls a suicide hotline.\n\nMan enters therapy, joins a group to quit drinking again, takes medication. It's long and hard but he makes it. The girl is happy, but she seems to be fading slowly as the months pass. She thinks she might be finally letting go and crossing over, her reward for having saved him. Eventually she departs with a smile.\n\nTwist ending: there was no ghost. That was his guilt and depression personified. It was always his own subconscious, the part of him that hated and blamed himself for the girl's death. Sure, the guilt drove him to quit drinking once, but the fact that he couldn't move on drove him into ever deeper despair. All the people with \"ghosts\" are the same way, haunted by their pasts. Last shot is him walking down the street, content, but as we zoom out we see just how many of the people around him have ghosts, and how widespread the problem is.\n\n  ",

This works well on Facebook where there's an awful lot of stupidity and unfounded information posted by an awful lot of people.\n\nIf the interaction is not important now or in the future, I just minimize my interactions as much as possible. I politely or, if they're really being a jerk, impolitely leave the interaction. A polite way I use is \"Well, we really strongly disagree on this, and I don't think we can change each others' minds, so how about we just move on.\"\n\nIf they've a right to instruct or tell me what to do and I know they're wrong, how I answer depends on how important whatever they're telling me to do is. If I REALLY disagree with it and I can get away with it, I ask them \"are you sure?\" and to tell me in writing to cover my ass if that's an option. And I don't do that in front of other people because that just gets them all defensive.\n\nThe trick is to know when it's worth continuing the interaction and when it's not... and to not get out quickly if it's the latter.",

        "body": "After seeing the recent shit storm after GLOs post etc and a further call from some of the ECs. I thought after being a long time lurker it would be time to throw my 2c in the pool. \n\n For the younger guys on this Sub-Reddit who are graduating from HS, University etc. These pointers may give you a leg up when joining the more formal workforce. \n\nN.B, The experience is from whilst working in a Multi-National European Manufacturing company. Where I was in global functions during the past 4 years. Working with a lot of different cultures, languages & nationalities. \n\nTL:DR, Do a good job, be prepared & you *might* be rewarded for it.  \n\n1)\tYou have a lot to learn.\n\nWhen you start in the workforce you know next to nothing, even if you graduated from a top level University. Business\/Trades are very different from the theory of the lecture theatre & classroom.\nHowever most colleagues & managers are ready and willing to help you, if you are humble, eager to listen and learn. Ask for help when you don\u2019t know what to do. But make sure you only ask once and then again only for clarification. Take a lot of notes on the process & ways of working to help you in the future. You will forget 90% of what you\u2019re told in on-boarding. So write it down.  \nWhen you\u2019re unsure. Try to answer the question yourself before asking colleagues. Even if you have to do it out loud. \n\nThis will enable you to get up to speed a lot quicker than your other new colleagues and become a productive member of the team. It normally takes 4-8 months to get up to speed, make sure you\u2019re closer to 4 months. \n\n2)\tDevelop a Bullshit detector, fast. \n\nYou\u2019ll meet plenty of people in large companies who get paid for doing absolutely nothing. They push paper and attend meetings without getting anything done. Avoid these people like the plague. \nIf anyone says they are \u201cBusy\u201d they are either horrendous at organising their time or lying. People with a high workload generally get stuff done and don\u2019t need to inform people how \u201cBusy\u201d or \u201cImportant\u201d they are. They also tend to use a lot of meaningless buzz works & phrases. \n\n3)\tBe open to constructive criticism. Even when it sucks. \n\nAsk for feedback on how you are performing & what others would have done differently with the same information. See & analyse how you are interacting and working with colleagues and what you can do to improve\/develop improving the performance of the team you are working in. \n\nSeek out areas in which you need development to improve them as much as possible. Do this on a 4-6 month basis with colleagues and record how you are progressing within the first 18 months. You\u2019ll be surprised how much you\u2019ll improve in such a short period of time without realising it. Don\u2019t leave it just for your annual appraisal with your boss. \n\n4)\tTurn up to all meetings with paper and at least 2 pens. \n\nFocus on the meetings objectives and get it done as efficiently as possible. Don\u2019t be distracted by email, WhatsApp etc. whilst you\u2019re in a meeting. Leave the laptop & mobile on your desk*.\n*Unless you\u2019re the one running the meeting and need it for presentations, charts etc. \n\nThe 2nd pen is in case the 1st one runs out. Always be prepared for system failure. \n\n5)\tDiscover & understand your strengths & weaknesses.\n\nSolidify & pursue your strengths, minimise the amount of work that is dependent on your weaknesses. Time wise try to improve both but concentrate 70% on your strengths, 30% on your 3 weakest areas. This has worked for well for me.  \n\nSkill development doesn\u2019t need to be relevant for the work you are currently doing or want to do in the future. However it does need to be done off the clock, by first reading\/learning then applying in low risk areas within the work you\u2019re doing. \n\nPodcasts are perfect for commutes. I would recommend; \n\n\u2022\tJocko Podcast \n\u2022\tArt of Charm\n\u2022\tThe Minimalists podcast\n\n6)\tBuild a network of diverse colleagues.\n\nGet to know the people in your cross functional teams by finding out about them. Don\u2019t only hang around with only the other young employees \/ new hires. Older guys generally have been around the block and can save you a lot of time and effort getting information, money, contacts etc. \nOnce you have a good relationship, if there are any 50\/50 decisions on the table 9 times from 10 they will back your idea based on the trust that you have built. \n\n\u2022\tDale Carnegies \u2013 How to win friends & influence people is a good starting point for this. \n\n7)\tProduce high quality work, always. \n\nEasier said than done. In the beginning it\u2019s a ball ache to do the little extras, but 6-12 months in you\u2019ve built the discipline to automatically do these extras. The devil is in the details, but the payoff for your career & reputation is massive. You\u2019ll be first in line for mentorships, course & trainings as you\u2019ve proved your worth without asking for anything.  \n\nThis will set you apart from 80% of your colleagues within the first 2 months. \n\n8)\tGive your manager & colleagues praise when things go right. \n\nIf you\u2019re young & making mistakes (which is completely normal & anticipated) your boss will most likely be taking some shit for you & shouldn\u2019t be telling you to begin with. If you continue to make the same mistake over and over. That\u2019s on you and needs to be stopped ASAP. \n\nOnce the tide begins to change and projects are coming in on time, early and under budget. Make sure when telling people that it was due to their leadership & guidance. You manager should then be able to leverage a higher salary for you next time round & entrust you as their right hand man. Opening doors to more interesting projects & higher level individuals in the company. \n\n9)\tSalary increases need solid objectives. \n\nOnce you have put in the work and are beginning to get a grip of the objectives in your role. Start asking your manager what you need to do to get a salary increase. Hit these objectives and then ask for the salary increase. If you\u2019re not given this without a valid explanation begin to look for a new company to work for. \n\nIt took me 9 months longer than it should to be get a salary increase which resulted in a loss of \u20ac5k in earnings. Not a great loss but still a bit annoying. \n\n10)\tLive overseas. \n\nIf you get the chance to live over-seas for a small amount of time. Do it! It pushes your comfort zone very quickly. It will accelerate your personal resilience, maturity & development. If applicable learn the local language as much as you can. Try to make local friends & don\u2019t just hang around with Ex-pats. Your experience will be richer for it. \n",

I often wonder what this country would have been like if Bush's swift-boaters hadn't succeeded in attacking McCain by slurring him in suggesting through right wing news sites he had a secret \"Black\" daughter who was actually his adopted Bangladeshi daughter during the 2000 Republican primary campaign.  Would he have been a better leader during 9\/11?  Would he have gotten us into Iraq?  How would our country be different if he had won in 2000?  Yes the 2008 election brought us Palin but it was also one of the best and cleanest elections defined by debate and ideas and not personal attacks.  I would have opposed McCain's ideas but recognized the debate and his fitness for the presidency.  McCain is my respected and honorable opponent with which to debate the questions and ideas that make this country great (even if he is a bit senile now).\n____\nEdit 2: to all the people saying all Republicans are evil and must be defeated. \n\nIf we are to lead as Progressives and Social Democrats we must recognize that Republicans like McCain are defined by service, morality and sacrifice while men like Trump are defined by greed, power and selfishness.  We have to see the differences within the Republican party.  We must honor the conservative opponent who is honest and open minded, who comes to the table without fear or prejudice.  We must see McCain as our respected opponent who we must debate until we convince, and Trump as the enemy who's ideas we must defeat.\n____\nIf you're looking for reason's to respect and honor McCain while still respectfully disagreeing with his ideas and policies watch these:\n\n* [McCain's 2008 concession speech](https:\/\/youtu.be\/NvgqRKYapU8?t=21)\n* [McCain defending Obama from birthers](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jrnRU3ocIH4)\n* [McCain's absolute opposition to American torture during the Bush presidency](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UDWdKix0Ees)\n* [McCain's relationship with the press and defense of a free press.

        "body": "Married for over 30 years. \n\n* Lust is what you feel the first couple of years. You can't help it. It overwhelms you. You want to be with the person, to touch them, to have sex with them. You are sad when you are away from them. It is a chemical reaction that promotes breeding. It dies with time. Any relationship less than 3 years old is probably fueled by that.\n\n* Love is a choice you make to be amused by the failings of another as well as their talents and beauty. You acknowledge the role they play in improving you and your role in improving them. Love is a decision make a hundred times a day - not an urge or romance or something you cannot help. You do not fall in love. You fall in lust. Love you push. Lust pulls you.\n\n* If you feel like you are doing 80% of the work in a relationship, you are probably only doing half, really.\n\n* Marriage should not be entered into lightly. When you get married, you are agreeing to live a human life with another person. Human lives include disease, injury, tears, death, betrayal, and horrors you cannot imagine. You are saying, \"We're going to do our whole lives together.\" Sure, you can set boundaries beyond which the marriage contract is invalidated, but be aware of what's coming. They are going to get sick. You are going to have to carry them - sometimes for years or forever. They are going to get ugly and fat and old. They are going to change hobbies and interests and communication style. It's a whole life. That's a long time. Marriage is not about being happy - it's about deciding you will share two lives as one. And that has great moments, but it is also awful.\n\n* Love is conditional. Break the conditions, and love is over. Everyone should clearly state their boundaries early on. If you do this, it is over. Then, when they do that, you actually have to end it. Not go through a grieving process of denial, anger, bargaining, and renegotiation. If that was the line, then that was it.\n\n* Be able to break up with people. If you are afraid to lose someone to the point that you allow them to harm you, you've got a problem. Dating is a great chance to practice telling someone it is over and losing your fear of ending relationships that are not good for you.\n\n* Once you have kids, the conditions for the marriage have changed. You thought the wedding was the moment you got married? No, it was when she had your kid. The kid is more important that your happiness, more important than your self-actualization, your hobbies, your interests, your TV shows, your friends, or anything else. The child is now the top priority. You two are going to fight bitterly over what is best for the child, if you are doing your jobs right, and you will compromise, and you will make mistakes. But once there are children, your threshold for what pushes you out the door has to change. You can't just walk out because they got fat, or because they did it with the poolboy one time. You have to think \"What's best for the whole family\" not \"My precious ego and happiness.\"\n\nI could keep going, but I'm out of time.\n\n\n",

        "body": "I have the unfortunate distinction of being 3\/3 on calling divorces in my friend circle. As somebody who made all the wrong decisions with my first GF, I can smell insecurity and fear-driven decisions from a mile away.\n\nSo when certain couples get married for the wrong reasons I can usually see it when others can't because I recognize all the same mistakes I made.\n\nEDIT: Wow, didn't expect this to be popular. I'll list some things I look out for based on my experience:\n\n1. Trying to \"fix\" somebody. I got into a relationship with my first GF because I tried to fix her problems and be the knight in shining armor as I rescued m'lady from her problems. It doesn't matter if the male or female is doing the rescuing, it usually doesn't end well.\n\n2. Socioeconomics matter. I know we are supposed to only focus on the love aspect, but how a person was brought up can cause points of friction. One of the couples I called was a marriage between a wealthy girl and middle class guy. She never ever had to worry about money, but he always had to budget. For some reason they never discussed money beforehand and when they married and she expected a nice house, he couldn't deliver. She legitimately thought he didn't love her or else he would buy her a house. I knew she wanted this, and I knew he couldn't deliever, yet he was so afraid to lose her that he just hoped the gods of love would solve this problem.\n\n3. Which brings me to my last red flag. Not discussing in detail how they expect their lives to pan out. It doesn't matter if the plan actually works, but getting an understanding of where your life partner stands is key. All 3\/3 couples never discussed things like what kind of a house they want, how many kids, who will take care of ageing parents etc. A few expensive divorces later this is what all my buddies said they wished they would do.\n\nThis is not a complete list of course as other subtleties matter. But usually any one of these glaring red flags is a sign that things are so dandy.",

        "body": "Golf is often the choice of white collar folk because of it's social aspect. You can take time to focus on an activity outside away from people and talk. The game requires a lot of skill, but as a sport it's not one where you sweat a lot or lose your breath. So you and your golfing partners can walk around and talk about work or bond over the sport. It's a good way to build relationships. Also it's a good way to meet people as well, as one person can show up to a course and wait for a group needing a 4th. Plus there's the exclusivity of the club house. \n\nGolf isn't always a status sport, there are folks who aren't upper or middle class that play, but I've found it's really common among the white collar set to have at least some knowledge of the game. It's less grimey than bowling, less intellectual than chess, and more social than cross word or other puzzles. Also, the real person you're playing against is yourself, because you're always trying to get better to improve your score.\n\n... I don't play, but my dad (and later my brothers) was obsessed with the game and I practically grew up on a golf course. I have watched a lot of golf on the tv, and been to some very fancypants courses. From what I know of people who play and the history of the game, this is how I understand it. You can play it just to play it, or you can use it as a tool to gain connections and level up in your work",

Driving back on a dirt road at about 30mph (give or take 5mph) I had this awful sense of being watched. Before I could turn to look out my window (passenger side) my uncle quickly shouted, \"Don't!\" I completely froze. My heart felt like it was beating out of my chest then completely stopped when I heard a *tap tap* on my window. My uncle sped up and was loudly praying in my native language. I didn't know what was going on and thought it was over till our truck suddenly dipped from the bed. My uncle then started saying, \"Look at me\" and \"Don't turn away\" over and over. Then I heard it again, *tap tap* but from the window behind me. It was getting harder for me to breathe and I wanted to cry. A minute or two passed and the truck dipped again. My uncle looked around and sighed. It was quiet besides the truck and the road. He looked at me and said, \"We will ask your father to do a prayer in the morning. So the evil will forget our faces.\" (Navajo to English equivalent). I remember curling up on the seat and just staring at the radio watching the time. Listening to my uncle sing an old prayer till we got to my grandmother's house. \n\nEDIT: I called my uncle because I had a nightmare about that night. We talked about it for a bit. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see faces. Just eyes. Like brake lights you see on the road. It watched you.\u201d (Navajo to English equivalent) Before hanging up I tried joking with him about it. \"Why didn\u2019t you just step on the brake when it was in the back?\" No laughter. Just a pause. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t alone.\u201d \n\nEDIT 2: Yes, any kind of window tapping still scares the shit out of me.

They didn't suddenly start 'hustling' on their 5th attempt.\n\nI know people who had successful businesses unexpectedly fail, and never manage to regain not just that level of success, but *any* success.  They didn't suddenly forget to work hard.\n\nSuccess is *hugely* about being in the right place at the right time, which is more often than not deeply rooted in luck.  It's totally understandable that people want to think that their success, which they worked so hard to achieve, is thanks to their ideas and hard work, rather than that a seemingly inconsequential decision to shoot with a Sony instead of a Fuji, or post only in black and white, or take photos of trees, or whatever it was that happened to catch the public's attention. \"If that didn't work, I'd still have got there eventually.\" Or maybe they'd have just missed the boat.\n\nHe boasts about being the 2nd result on Google for 'street photography'.  There must be thousands of people whose passion is street photography out there online, yet only 1 can ever be 2nd.  Are they *all* just not trying as hard as him?  Why is he only 2nd behind Wikipedia?  I'd be surprised if even he thinks it's purely because he isn't 'hustling' enough.\n\nIs there *really* room for them all to be as or more successful than him?\n\nApparently he started with 'just' a Leica in 2001, before anyone else was really doing it, and before interest in it exploded.  The luck of all those stars aligning is the absolute foundation of his success.\n\nHere's another example.  In 1999 Phil Askey started DPReview, just as digital photography began to explode.  He obviously worked hard, and rode the wave of market growth to build his site into the top resource on the internet, until he was bought out by Amazon.\n\nHe then used took that money and identified another, not dissimilar area that was beginning to explode.  He took with him the same intelligence and work ethic, plus all the lessons he'd learned from his previous business.  And where did that wave of market growth he'd so cleverly identified take him this time? [No posts since 2013.](http:\/\/www.zemotoring.com\/)\n\nNow here's a question - would you follow his advice on how to build a successful website?  Would your feelings on the matter be exactly the same if I'd asked you when he still ran DPReview?\n\nHalf this guy's tips (e.g. charging lots, turning away customers) he can do *because* he's successful - it's not how he became it.\n\nSadly, hard work definitely doesn't guarantee success in life.  And I know this, because I'm lazy and financially comfortable, and can see some of my smarter friends paddling like mad just to keep their heads above water.\n\nYou go tell the single mother working two jobs to support her family that she isn't 'hustling' enough.  Or the couple desperately putting 100+ hours a week into their failing startup business that they just need to work harder.  All they need is a Leica, and 'a touch of luck'.\n\n>If I can do it, you can do it too\n\nA scratch card millionaire could say the same.",

        "body": "throw away for obvious reasons.\n\nSo today, I did something I shouldn't have done, without realizing it, and it nearly cost me my life. I was flying a cessna into a dirt strip to meet a few friends. I had never done an actual dirt strip before, so right off the bat I was a little bit out of my element. To compound this, the strip itself was located in some very hilly terrain nearby a mountain chain, so it was a higher altitude than I was used to operating in as well (most of my flying is at sea level, here we were around 2500' MSL).\n\nMy flight out to the strip was simple, uneventful, and fun. When I arrived at the strip I circled it in a low pass, checking the runway for obstructions, damage, etc. as I had been trained. What I failed to take note of was how quickly the ground rolled up into a small ridge off the end of the strip. I was too focused on the condition of the strip and allowed myself to tunnel-vision out other important factors. The wind sock was barely alive, and I couldn't detect any noticeable drift, so I chose to land on the uphill (but also tailwind) direction so as to aid in shortening my rollout. I figured the grade would be more effective than the very light tailwind would be detrimental. This approach faced me directly at that tall ridge. Coming onto final I was properly configured but way too fast, probably owing to my being uncomfortable with the environment and having to descend late with attitude instead of power. I had started my approach to close to the strip, so I didn't have time to bleed off speed once I was on the right glideslope. About halfway down the strip I was still 20' off the ground and decided I needed to go around. Throttle to full, dumped one notch of flaps. I had a good recovery, but I noticed suddenly that I was now off the end of the runway and had only gained maybe 100'. I immediately double checked all my gauges, determined the engine was functioning properly and at maximum output, and realized that I was too heavy at too high of an altitude for a steep climb. At almost the same moment I realized that I was heading into a narrow V-shaped pseudo valley that ended in that high sloping ridge I mentioned before.\n\nI have watched videos of this exact situation taking place, and in all of them the plane ends up crashing, mostly with fatalities. I felt, for the first time in my flying life, a surge of panic. I radio'd to my friend, who had just arrived at the strip, to begin a call to emergency services. At the same time I clicked open the door so that when I crashed, if I was able to move I wouldn't be locked in by a jammed door.\n\nWhile I did this, I pitched as high as I could and rode my stall horn. I'd pitch until it chirped, let off a bit, and maintain pressure until I heard it chirp again.\n\nI made an incredibly stupid mistake at this point. My mind was racing, and my fear clouded my training. I saw my speed was low, and instinctively reduced my flaps to zero. I lost a LOT of lift, and instantly realized my mistake. At that point though, I couldn't put flaps back in without more airspeed and I didn't have enough altitude to get any.\n\nI was committed to this. I will probably never, ever forget these next few moments. As I came up to the ridge, I pulled back hard enough to make the stall horn go off consistently, and I felt (or so I thought I felt) the cavitations in the airplane. I decided I'd rather stall into the terrain at 40kts from a short height than fly into it with 60+kts of airspeed. At this point I was MAYBE 5' above the ground. I am unbelievably lucky that on the other side of the patch of grass and bushes the hill fell away nearly 1500'. Right as the plane lirched and I felt the last of my lift fade away, I brought the nose down hard and dove into the valley on the other side. I recovered easily, and circled around the hilltop back to the strip to inform my friend that I was alright.\n\nWhat I did today was reckless, dangerous, stupid, and completely unforgivable. If any competent CFI, DPE, or FAA shot-caller saw me performing these actions, I'd expect fully to be losing my license.\n\nI know that we all receive extensive training on the Hazardous Attitudes and on situational awareness, CRM, decision making skills, and the ability to walk away from bad situations. My favorite piece of advice from a CFI was \"A superior pilot uses superior judgement to avoid situations requiring the use of superior skill.\" I had always thought that I lived up to those standards, and that I had taken my training to heart, but it is scary just how wrong I was without even realizing it.\n\nFor the student pilots and low hour PPLs reading this, don't be me. I'm the best case scenario. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have died needlessly over the years because of poor planning, poor preparation, and poor piloting like mine today. I know we all think and say it, but I didn't realize until today the incredibly deep truth of the attitude that **this isn't a joke. It is serious. It isn't ancillary, dismissable, or carefree.**\n\nYou can die because of a single mistake, a single wrong move, a single late decision. I made my mistakes early enough, and made my right decisions early enough, that I survived today by a margin of *five fcking feet*.\n\nI'm home safe now (and had the best landing of my life when I returned to my home airport), and I'm still shaking a little bit.\n\nI doubt this post will be popular with our seasoned pilots, but I want you to be angry at me, and I want other pilots who might be like me to seriously evaluate their attitude when flying. If there's an inkling of a dinkling of a chance that you think you're being lax about some aspect of your skill or your planning, don't ignore it. Fix it. It could save your life, and the lives of others.",

She told me (years later) that she was trying to remember this life, now, before she opened that door to find herself a widow. \n\nWhen they knocked a second time, she answered. \"Are you Mrs Shlein?\" \"Yes, I am\" she said. \" Well ma'am, were collecting funds for a dance at the officer's club, and...\"\n\nMy mom started screaming and crying and bearing on them...\"how could you!?

It's been several years since I have started this journey. Typical bluepill background. Typical Asian upbringing. School smart but not street smart. High school was a dud and I wanted to committed suicide during my junior year. Been told I was cute before but never had the balls to do anything. Been an orbiter, emotional tampon, \"best friend\", the whole nine yards. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy journey started in 2013 when I discovered PUA, then to TRP, then to MGTOW, and now I'm just a guy with a mission in life with bit of knowledge and better boundaries. Went through all the stages of grief and learn to accept women and their.. special ways. They aren't meant to be men so I can't expect them to have the same values as men. Now life tends to be more.. amusing and less.. self inflicting drama. I am way less thirsty around women and no longer asking 'why' about a lot of things. Instead I now know 'why' and tend just shrug things off when they don't work out.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBelow is a list of ideals I have come across on this journey, things I have struggle with, and the tools that had help me along the way. I ask you to keep an open mind and take everything with a grain of salt. Do you own research and conduct your own experiments and observations. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNote: All listed books can be purchased on the Amazon Kindle App. Save trees, save space, and read anytime, anywhere. Use Audio Narrations upgrades for times like traveling, cleaning, or working out.\n\n* *Recommend Youtube:*\n * *Benefits Of Reading - The Improvement Pill*\n * *7 Ways to Maximize Misery - CGP Grey*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor curious newbies:\n\n* *Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn't fit in with the core belief. -Frantz Fanon*\n* *SIDEBAR, SIDEBAR, SIDEBAR!!*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor women:\n\n* *Recommend Books:*\n * *\"Self-Made Man\" by Norah Vincent*\n * *\"How to Get the Guy\" by Matthew Hussey (He also has a YouTube Channel and live seminars for ladies)*\n \n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The First Rule of TRP is: You Do Not Talk About TRP. The Second Rule of TRP is: You Do Not Talk About TRP.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWARNING: TRP is not a safe subject. *Cue eye-rolls.* The truth is hard to hear and much harder to accept. It is never popular but always a necessity. There are those who would use TRP philosophy incorrectly just like those who use religions or politics to suppress or terrorized others. Keep your mouth shut and your thoughts to yourself whenever these type of topics come up in public. Self-preservation keeps you safe and others safe. Let people think how they want to think.\n\n* *Recommend Methods:*\n * *Do not talk how 'alpha' you are or how 'beta' someone is in public. It's sad and pathetic. You wouldn't be here if you were a natural alpha. We all were betas. Be humble.*\n * *Do not put down or insult women for not sleeping with you. They are not evil, prudes, bitches, cunts, sluts, whores, or etc because they won't help you get your dick wet. They are human too. They have the freedom of choice and numerous of men to choose from. It is just a different world for women.*\n * *TRP is a brotherhood. For those of you who want to help our brothers who are plugged in, please keep in mind of how much you resisted swallowing the pill. Just keep an ear out when they start dropping hints. They will be ready when they will be ready. Do not force it. You can only lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink it.*\n\n* *Recommend Youtube:*\n * *Derek Sivers Keep Your Goals to Yourself - TED*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A Different Perspective than the Standard Disney Dream:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWelcome to TRP. Somehow you arrived here because your method of attracting women isn\u2019t working and you are looking for different answers. It is consider madness if you repeat the same action over and over and expect a different result. It is NOT wrong of you wanting to get better at attracting women just as it is NOT wrong of women wanting to be more attractive to men. \n\n* *Recommend Methods:*\n * *Use the Five Stages of Grief to identify your emotions and state of mind. It WILL be hard and does take a lot time to come to an acceptance of TRP perspective. It is completely normal to feel negative feelings such as anger, hate, depression, feeling lied to, exploited, ignorant, etc. What you are feeling is the change. You will breakdown. You must breakdown. Then you will rebuild yourself. We men are taught to not express our troubles or negative emotions in public view due to all sorts of backlash if we do. TRP is a safe and anonymous place where you rant your hatred, your negativity, your mistakes, and your grief in the privacy of your own home and your own mind. This is where we can get honest answers, feedback, and guidance from those who were in the similar situations. Be patience, be kind, and be grateful once you are unplugged.*\n\n* *Recommend Books:*\n * *\"The Game\" by Neil Strauss (This is where it all started for me. The first book. The knowledge, values, and beliefs that contradicted my own at the time.)*\n * *\"Practical Female Psychology for the Practical Male\" by Joseph South, David Clare*\n * *\"The Rational Male\" by Rollo Tomassi*\n * *\"The Rational Male - Preventive Medicine\" by Rollo Tomassi*\n * *\"The Rational Male - Positive Masculinity\" by Rollo Tomassi*  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Traditional Male Roles in Modern Times?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBe on guard with your traditional male role. There are plenty of people willing to take advantage of it. Men roles and women roles are being questioned and everybody is confused. Mother nature will always be the invisible government of the land. However, mankind's 'laws' are always changing, for better or worse. Men, please do some research for your legal rights (or lack of in some areas). Remember, women have the potential to use men as successful objects just as men have the potential to exploit women as sex objects.\n\n* *How unhappy and trapped males look like when taken advantage of or being used:*\n * *Provider\/ATM - Guys who used for their resources and receive nothing in return.*\n * *Best friend\/Emotional tampon\/Orbiter\/White knight - Guys who listen to a girl's problems, are always hanging around them, and defend their honor in hopes of getting laid.*\n * *Marriage\/Divorce Raped - Guys that their wives got tired of and lost everything in a divorce.*\n * *Kids\/Child Support - Guys that have children they are required to pay for.

You WILL become passive aggressive when you are disappointed. Women are not stupid. They can smell a guy's agenda or ulterior motives a mile away.

A lot of relationships fail because one or both parties are not educated about the other sex and\/or their own needs and boundaries. Ask yourself honestly and deeply why you want to be in a relationship. You should NEVER depend on one person to fulfill your EVERY single need. Don't put all your eggs in one basket for love, emotional support, loyalty, and etc. Diversify your love between all of your family, friends, coworkers, mentors, etc. Learning to not 'own' another person and be whole and happy on your own is having an abundance mentality. She is NOT yours, it is just your turn. \n\n* *Nothing last forever, even stars die. -Neil deGeneres Tyson*\n\n* *Recommend Book:*\n * *\"Men Are Like Waffles \u2014 Women Are Like Spaghetti\" by Bill and Pam Farrell*\n\n* *Recommend subreddit:*\n * *Relationships (Scary stories)*\n * *Relationship_Advice (More scary stories)*\n\n* *Recommend Youtube:*\n  * *How Romanticism Ruin Love - The School of Life*\n  * *Reasons to Remain Single - The School of Life*\n  * *'Mark Gungor Tale of Two Brains Full'*\n\n* *Recommend blog:* \n * *blog.kareldonk.com - Featured Topic - Love*\n\n&nbsp;\n \n**Frame Control & Personal Boundaries**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is a way to control your reptilian brain or 'reactive' side. Reacting is instinctual.  Responding is a conscious choice.  When something happens, our body is going to react automatically regardless.  The trick is to become aware of this initial reaction, resist doing anything, involve your higher intelligence by considering options, possible ramifications, who you want to be, and what is going to be in your best interest, and, then, choose how to respond. \n\n* *Man is affected, not by events, but by his view he takes of them. -Epictetus*\n\n* *Recommend Method:*\n * *Stoicism is a great philosophy to adapt.*\n * *You are the CEO of YOUR life. Learn to make decisions for yourself and lead. You are the captain. Let the other person(s) decide if they want to follow. You choose who stays and who goes. Anyone toxic, can include family and friends, need to be let go. All relationships are give and take. Keeping scores in your head is fine but don't get obsess with it. You are the average of the five people you spent your most time with. Crabs in a barrel mentality is an easy red flag.*\n * *Practice saying 'no' out loud with confident and conviction. Learn to say 'sorry' less and only when it is absolutely necessary. Take your time talking. Don't rush things and don't let anyone rush you. Be content during those silent pauses. Gather your thoughts Pick your battles wisely. You can never change a person's world view overnight. Walk away if needed.*\n * *Stay amused. Have a play and\/or flirty tone when teasing. It's banter and it's supposed to be fun. Test yourself 'being mean' cautiously. Don't backpetal whenever possible. Never get into a fight with or over a women. You automatically lost frame.*\n  * *Imagery training. I have a rather good imagination and tend to play devil advocate with myself. I \"test\" myself against scenarios with my ideal oneities, bitches, AMOG, betas, white knights, femnazi, and etc. You can do it anytime but you must envision REALISTIC solutions. It teaches you where your state of mind is and how much control you have over your emotions and reactions.* \n\n* *Recommend Books:*\n * *\"Extreme Ownership\" by Jocko Willink*\n * *\"The Undefeated Mind\" by Alex Lickerman*\n * *\"A Guide to the Good Life, The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy\" by William B.

Repeat: Wanting sex is NORMAL for humans. It is a built-in nature for all lifeforms to have sex and reproduce. Just learn to control your biological sexual urges so it doesn't control you. STOP being so thirsty. Sex is great and all but it's not the one thing in this world you should strive for. Your value as a man is not defined by the quantity or quality of women you can bring to bed. Ask yourself honestly and deeply why you want sex. \n\n* *Destroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed the major source of action. For proof of this, observe what happens to any animal after it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a cow after it has been altered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the male, whether man or beast, all the FIGHT that was in him -Napoleon Hill*\n\n* *Recommend Methods:*\n * *Quit using porn and fapping. Practice semen retention. The urge of sex is one of and the MOST POWERFUL driving force of man. You are wasting your drive for fake pixels. (by far one of the hardest thing for me to achieve.)*\n * *Use a condom and wash it out after. Sperm-jackers are real.*\n * *Don't EVER have sex with a drunk girl. You are just asking for a rape accusation.*\n * *For proof of consent: Take selfies throughout the night and save a screenshot of a \"Awesome night\" text and her reply after a night of sex and upload it to the cloud like Google Drive. Invest in a dash cam or home security cameras.*\n * *Don't EVER 'date' coworkers\/clients. You are risking your income\/job. Don't shit where you eat.*\n * *I used to suffer from premature ejaculation. To last longer, I started doing Kegal exercises and invest in a Fleshlight. Tips I have learned is to use a stopwatch to keep track of time (try to go for 30 mins) and a playlist of sexy songs (YouTube: THE BEDROOM PLAYLIST PT. II R&B\/SOUL) to get a sense of a slow thrust rhythm, breathing pace down, mix up body positions, and fingering and licking simultaneously.*\n * *Check\/increase your testosterone levels. Google the benefits.

Your thoughts are your reality.\n\n* *Recommend Method:*\n * *Google \"MBTI Test\" to find out how you think. We aren't all meant to be social butterflies. (I have INTP personality, which is 3% of the population. Really helped me out to accept that I think and see things differently from the majority.)*\n\n* *Recommend Websites:*\n * *16personalities, 23andme, EverlyWell.*\n\n* *Recommend Youtube:*\n * *\"An Instruction Manual To Oneself\" - The School of Life* \n\n* *Recommend Book:*\n * *\"The Spiritual Awakening Process\" by Mateo Sol and Aletheia Luna*\n * *\"Old Souls\" by Aletheia Luna*\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**A Man's Mission In Life & Being Selfish** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe most important of concept of TRP is converting your belief from making 'women' being the center of your universe to make 'yourself' the center of your universe. A man's mission should be his MAIN source of happiness. To self-improve is to self-invest which requires you to have self-discipline, learn to love yourself, and put your needs first. An easy concept for self-love is to love and treat yourself like you would love the women of your dreams. Being selfish and putting yourself first is hard for most men to grasp. It is because we have been taught all of our life to self-sacrifice for the greater good of others. Follow your efforts, not your passion. You learn the skills you need in life by searching for it.\n\n* *Recommend Blog*\n * *\"So She Dump You?...

Don't be connected 24\/7. Disable\/silent notifications off your apps.*\n * *Delete all of your personal social media. You can start slowly by limiting your friends to under 100 count and set it to private. Eliminate people who you don't know, never talk to anymore, are toxic, or their posts are just drama.

Understand that generally \"men\" don't care what men wear but \"women\" do because a woman's SMV is mostly based on her looks. Women invested and max out their looks to gain the attention of high-value men. They compare themselves to other women and thus how their man look too.

Your daily time resource is 24 hours everyday so use at least one hour to workout. Try to not use your home as a gym. It has too many distractions. Your home is a place of relaxation.*\n * *Find a workout buddy or personal trainer that who knows what they are doing.

The percentage of types of human communication are consist of: 55% are body movements and facial expression, 38% are voice tone, volume, and pauses, and 7% are words. This is to help you see the subtle signals of attraction or the need to back off.  \n\n* *Recommend Methods:*\n * *Watch your favorite shows\/movies on silent. Look at the actor's facial expression and body movements.*\n * *Stand tall by using the pencil posture test and fix your forward neck or round shoulders by using the 'hang by your teeth' technique.*\n * *Use a computer stand to level your screen higher for a better sitting posture.*\n * *Place a pen in your mouth and start reading out loud. You should be able to pronounce every syllables, talk slower, take breaths and pauses, and get rid of 'umms' and 'uhh'.*\n * *Record yourself reading out loud. To focus on your tone and volume, place your recording device at different distances away from you. This should give you the idea of how loud and clearly you must be speak in order for the person to hear you. You should also listen to pitch of your voice and make sure it stay low.*\n * *Practicing maintaining eye contact by looking in the mirror.*\n * *Learn to sing. For some reason, singing tend to bring people together. When you and another person know the lyrics to a song, it's really cool feeling. Great for singing during car rides and karaoke nights. Take a few singing lessons from a tutor to learn breathing and pitch.* \n * *Learn how to storytell. Our stories are who we are. Share the jokes, the 'what the fuck' events, the scary adventures and your brainfart moments.

(Like asking how was her day was or what your goals in life are.) Save that for when you are together in person.*\n * *No wall text, no double texting, and write out your texts in compete words, sentences, and correct grammar.* \n * *Use 'statements' formats more often than 'questions' format. (Example: Instead of asking her if she is free, tell her a time, location, and activity of what you will be doing together. Take the lead and assume attraction.)*\n * *Do not drunk text or send nudes. (She got enough dick pics from other guys)*\n * *Make a phone call every once in awhile. Show that you got some balls.*\n * *Easy 'nexting' tells: If she responds back to reschedule, she is into you. However, if she 'stalls' without rescheduling, she is not into you. 2-3 strikes and she's out.*\n * *KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)*\n\n* *Recommend Youtube:*\n * *How to Text a Girl - sWooZie*\n * *Texting - Based Zeus*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The Art of Seduction**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLearning seduction or just basic female interaction. THIS is only when you are at a healthy mindset, have good habits formed, and basically got your shit together. PUA without TRP is basically bluepill mindset but redpill acting.\n\n* *Recommend Methods:*\n * *Make sure your logistics are in order before going anywhere, anytime. You will never know when the next opportunity will arise. Transportation? Check. Bedroom clean? Check. Condoms? Check.*\n * *You must LEAD at all times. IT IS YOUR responsibility to make the FIRST move and every move after that.*\n * *3 second rule: When you see an attractive women, don't think, approach. This gives your brain no time to develop any excuses. Don't restrain yourself to just weekends or night venues. Women are everywhere.*\n * *ACCEPT REJECTIONS GRACEFULLY. You CAN'T attract\/have sex with every attractive woman you see. There are too many factors to why a woman rejects you. Just say 'thank you for your time' and move on.*\n * *For first few outing keep it: fun, casual, interactive, cheap\/free, kino friendly, and low pressure. Never start off with a dinner or movie. Get ice cream cones, bowling, arcade, laser tag, a walk around a park, putt putt golf, hiking, swimming at beach\/pool, board games, and etc.*\n * *Topics to avoid: religion and politics.*\n * *Topics to use: music, movies\/tv shows, food you love\/hate, adventures, places you have been, happy childhood memories, scary stories, jokes, people watching, the surrounding environment, etc.*\n * *Don't be afraid to touch her! Sit next to her, hold her hand, high fives, hugs, fist bumps, make her twirl, hand slapping game, and etc.*\n * *Kino map: Shoulder -> upper arm -> wrist -> hands.*  \n * *When going for the kiss, make sure to isolate her from the public view or from people she knows. A person's public reputation can greatly differs from their private desires.* \n * *Keep a little fun sexual tension alive. Use sexual innuendos. Wink, slowly bite lower half of lips, slowly lick top half of lips, smirk, grab\/slap her ass playfully, and etc.*\n * *Push and Pull during the interaction. You're not sprinting to the finish line. Escalate and rest on your terms. Give her room to chase. Think it like baking a cake.*\n \n* *Recommend Method:*\n * *Take a PUA Bootcamp to have a coach in the field to give your honest feedback.

We live in a very fucked up world. Somewhere, someone else has it worse than you. You were at the bottom but now know the way up. Work hard but do enjoy the little moments and achievements. Laugh at your mistakes and look at how far you had come. Don't compare your life to others or how perfect it 'should' to be. Success in life is when you can smile and say 'yeah, that was fun'. \n\n* *The life of every individual, viewed as a whole and in general, and when only its most significant features are emphasized, is really a tragedy; but gone through in detail it has the character of a comedy. - Arthur Schopenhauer*\n\n* *Recommend Youtube:*\n * *The Philosophy of Rick and Morty - Wisecrack*\n * *The Lottery of Life - The School of Life*\n",

Obviously, the latter are extremely important, but they\u2019ve been adequately covered elsewhere, and there just isn\u2019t space to include them here.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**My background**  \nPicked on in school, small and sickly, didn\u2019t have a girlfriend until 18. Was dumped by her and spent the first 2 years of college pretty much celibate.  \nGot into redpill ideas through the old \u201cCitizen Renegade\u201d blog (which is now Heartiste). From there stumbled on RSD\u2019s infield videos.  \nStarted going out and approaching regularly. Approach anxiety and ceaseless rejection for months, but I kept at it. The odd success here and there.  \nAfter about 2 years I was fucking a new girl every fortnight or so, mostly 7s and 8s with the occasional turbo when fortune smiled on me. My current girlfriend is a 9, has done modelling etc.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Below is everything I know about getting the hottest women from cold approach pickup.**\nThis is specially engineered for getting 9s and 10s and dealing with the kind of bullshit these girls will inevitably give you.  \nIf you\u2019re more into sleeping with tons of 7s (and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that), this might be overkill.  \nWhen I was single I personally was one of those guys who would rather fuck half a dozen 9s\/10s in a year than 50 mid range girls, so my whole approach to game is based on optimizing for that.  \nTake it for what it is \u2014 I\u2019m not saying my approach is better, this is just how I roll based on my preferences.  \nThis is a long post. You may want to bookmark it and return to it later if you\u2019re particularly concerned with getting the hottest girls.   There\u2019s a lot of subtle points in here that won\u2019t be immediately clear on a first reading.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n---------\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**PART 1: THE ATTRACTION PROCESS**  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**1\\. Women are attracted to you because you have a stronger frame than they do.**  \nThat\u2019s all.  \nThere\u2019s nothing else to it.  \nAttraction is purely a function of the fact that:  \n1\\. you\u2019re a man  \n2\\. you have a *stronger frame* than the girl  \nAs a man, you naturally have a strong frame of reality whereas women don\u2019t. Therefore they value that. (Having a strong frame is a result of high testosterone levels.)  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**2\\. Women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one**  \nEvolution has designed women to be very flexible in terms of who they\u2019ll become attracted to.  \nWomen would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame (i.e. a natural leader) than a handsome guy with a weak frame (cowardice, uncertainty).  \nThat\u2019s because women who chose to fuck the latter ultimately had their genes rooted out of existence by the brutal conditions of ancestral life.  \nIn consequence, women now are very adaptable. They have the capacity to be attracted to almost ANY man so long as his frame is stronger than hers.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**3\\. A girl can ONLY get horny for you if you have a stronger frame than her.**  \nThink of this like a mathematical equation. There\u2019s no getting around it, no cheating it, no short-circuiting it. It is an immutable law.  \nWomen want to submit to you. They want to submit to a strong man. But she can\u2019t submit to you if your frame is weaker than hers.  \nPhysiologically, girls can\u2019t even become wet for a guy who has a weaker frame than they do. It\u2019s literally impossible.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**4\\. \u201cBe a man. Act like you have answers.\u201d (Bill Burr)**  \nWhat is a strong frame? Fundamentally, it\u2019s a sense of certainty in everything you do. This certainty manifests itself as calmness in the face of social pressure.  \nSimply put, in a cold approach pickup, the woman becomes attracted to you because you\u2019re more relaxed than she is.  \nThat\u2019s all.  \nThat might seem strange, but it\u2019s actually not.  \nThe very fact that you approached the girl at all demonstrates a massive amount of confidence and social value (either real or potential).  \nSo once you\u2019ve approached the girl and gotten her into a conversation, the game is yours to lose. She\u2019ll inevitably become attracted to you because you\u2019re a man, and because you have a stronger frame than she does.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**5\\. Relax**  \nYou will approach women, and you will make mistakes. That\u2019s fine. Women don\u2019t want you to be perfect. They only want you to be a man.  \nYou are not physically perfect. Neither am I. Neither is anyone.  \nWomen are not looking for perfection. They\u2019re only looking for a man who has a *stronger psychological frame* than they do.  \nAnd fortunately for you, you already have a naturally stronger frame than women.  \nAn example of this is how women will freak out over spiders or mice, jump up and down, scream, and so on, whereas a man will calmly deal with the situation without it breaking his frame.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**6\\. She tests your frame to test your masculinity. The two are the exact same thing.**  \nWomen are attracted to *masculinity*. And masculinity can be defined as a measure of how much pressure a man can endure without it breaking his frame.  \nWhen you approach a hot woman, she immediately starts trying to break down your frame.  \nShe\u2019s testing it for strength.  \nIf your frame crumbles in the face of her frame, she knows you\u2019re not a man \u2014 because men have a stronger frame than women.  \nFortunately, your frame will not crumble. A girl\u2019s frame will always \u201cbuckle\u201d under yours after you pass several of her tests. It\u2019s instinctual. Women want to be with the strong man. When she sees you have a strong frame she starts getting wet.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**7\\. \u201cListen, smile, nod, agree \u2014 then do what the fuck you were gonna do anyway.\u201d (Robert Downey Jr.)**  \nWomen test me all the time. Women have said things to me that are totally brutal \u2014 called me ugly, too short, a loser, etc.  \nMost of the women I approach will make a weird face or pretend to ignore me for the first 10-20 seconds.  \nIt doesn\u2019t penetrate. It doesn\u2019t cause any emotional reaction whatsoever inside me. I smile, nod, agree and then keep talking to her as if she\u2019s being nice to me.  \nEventually, she starts responding. Then she starts laughing. And then we have sex.  \nA woman\u2019s frame will ALWAYS buckle under yours. It\u2019s not a question of \u201cif\u201d, but \u201cwhen\u201d.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**8\\. Chasing hot girls gives you a \u201ccharge\u201d**  \nWhen you\u2019re first getting into game, it\u2019s fine to only approach 5s and 6s.  \nMany of these girls will be super nice to you, and that\u2019s cool. A lot of them are fantastic in bed.  \nBut once you start to get some experience, you\u2019re naturally going to want to move up the ladder and start laying 8s, 9s and 10s.  \nThis is a natural instinct, and it\u2019s good. It\u2019s okay to chase girls just because they\u2019re hot. These girls want you to chase them. If they didn\u2019t, they wouldn\u2019t make themselves hot.  \nPart of being a man is that you can appreciate a woman\u2019s beauty and femininity. It gives you a charge. And pursuing women who are \u201cout of your league\u201d (by society\u2019s false standards) also gives you a charge.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**9\\. Seducing a 9 is no different from seducing a 5**  \nThe process of attraction is exactly the same. The only difference is that the hot girl\u2019s frame is stronger than the chubby girl\u2019s.  \nBut ultimately, no matter how strong a hottie\u2019s frame is, your frame will always be stronger, because you\u2019re a man.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**10\\. Women will test you brutally when they want to sleep with you**  \nWhen you approach any hot girl, she\u2019ll test your frame HARD to see if it\u2019s strong.  \nShe\u2019ll act like a bitch. She\u2019ll pretend to ignore you. She\u2019ll tell you outright to go away.  \nShe wants to see if you\u2019ll buckle to social pressure, or if your frame will remain calm and consistent regardless of external feedback.  \nShe actually WANTS to sleep with you \u2014 but she needs to test your strength first.  \nDon\u2019t be fooled by the bitch persona for a second. It\u2019s a carefully cultivated TEST.  \nMost men fail the test because they don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re being tested.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**11\\. Fight Club analogy**  \nGetting a hot woman into bed is like the hazing scene in Fight Club where the new recruits are lined up outside the door.  \nTyler berates the recruits with personal insults. \u201cToo old, go away.\u201d \u201cToo fat, go away.\u201d  \nHe forces them to stand outside for days. He tells them there\u2019s no possibility they\u2019re getting in. Most give up. But the few who stay are ultimately invited inside.  \nSeducing the hottest women is the same. It\u2019s a WAR OF ATTRITION.  \nWomen will fuck pretty much any guy who\u2019s around at the end of the night so long as he has a stronger frame than she does.  \nBut you have to stick around. You can\u2019t leave when she insults you or acts like she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you. If you do, you\u2019re failing her tests.  \nWe\u2019ll get into the mechanics of passing these tests in a moment. First we need to talk about inner game, which is the basis of out-framing anyone.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n---------\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**PART 2:  INNER GAME**  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**12\\. The battle is won or lost inside you before it\u2019s ever fought**  \nWe\u2019ve said that the only way to AROUSE a woman to the point that she wants to sleep with you off cold approach is to pass her tests.  \nHow do you pass these tests?  \nThe first principle is to understand is that all tests are FRAME tests. The entire purpose of tests is to see if you have a strong frame that won\u2019t buckle under pressure.  \nTherefore, it\u2019s useless begin with talking about \u201chow to pass tests\u201d. The real value is in having a strong frame to begin with. As Sun Tzu says in the Art of War, \u201cevery battle is won or lost before it\u2019s ever fought.\u201d  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**13\\. The \u201cI am enough\u201d frame = the gold dust that gets you 9s and 10s**  \nThe basis of your inner game is the idea that \u201cyou are enough\u201d. In other words, you have value to women simply because you\u2019re a man.  \nEverything else is built upon that foundation.  \nYou don\u2019t have to \u201cdo\u201d anything to attract a girl. She\u2019s attracted to you simply because you\u2019re more relaxed than she is.  \nYou don\u2019t have to change anything. You don\u2019t have to improve your \u201cgame\u201d beyond what it\u2019s at now. You don\u2019t need to become better looking.  \nYou CAN do all these things if you want and they will help you. But you don\u2019t have to.  \nYou\u2019re already \u201cgood enough\u201d simply because you\u2019re a man \u2014 because you\u2019ve got testosterone and a dick. Women value that.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**14\\. Men and women are meant to get together**  \nWe fit together like a key and a lock.  \nThere have been studies done in which women smell men\u2019s sweaty t-shirts, and it changes the chemistry of their brain \u2014 making them more relaxed and calm.  \nYour \u201cmale-ness\u201d is inherently attractive to women. Same way as their femininity is inherently attractive to you.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**15\\. Standards are a myth \u2014 everyone is a horny scoundrel**  \nWe have been brainwashed in our culture into believing that people (women) have something called \u201cstandards\u201d.  \nWomen don\u2019t have any standards \u2014 not really. Neither do men.  \nImagine you\u2019re naked in bed with a \u201c4\u201d. She\u2019s kinda chubby, plain face, you probably wouldn\u2019t be proud of the lay, whatever. But her skin\u2019s soft, she smells good, and she\u2019s naked and wet.  \nAre you going to say no?  \nProbably not, if we\u2019re being honest with each other. You\u2019d almost definitely fuck her if you could be CERTAIN that (a) she\u2019d leave afterwards, and (b) no one would find out.  \nThere\u2019s a natural magnetism between men and women. We have no willpower around each other.  \nWomen are the same way. Take it from someone who\u2019s \u201cshot out of his league\u201d too many times to count.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**16\\. Be her cheat meal**  \nYou can be a \u201c4\u201d and she can be a \u201c9\u201d. *If the circumstances are right*, she\u2019ll fuck you so long as there\u2019s no downside. Why? Because sex feels good.  \nEven the hottest, slimmest yoga bunny pigs out on pizza every once in a while. It\u2019s human nature. We\u2019re not strong. We\u2019re weak.  \nWe pretend to have \u201cstandards\u201d to the outside world. But down deep inside, no one has any standards, and we know it. We have no will, no self-control.  \nHot women are the same.  \nIf you can hold frame, pass a woman\u2019s test, and lead her to somewhere sex can happen while creating plausible deniability, she WILL fuck you.  \nYou\u2019d be amazed how easy it is when you get it down.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**17\\. Stop thinking you need to be an \u201calpha\u201d to get hot girls \u2014 helpful at first but it will ultimately stress you out**  \nYour frame is: \u201cI am enough.\u201d  \nYour frame is NOT \u201cI\u2019m a badass alpha who\u2019s better than everyone\u201d.  \nThat\u2019s hard to uphold in the face of conflicting evidence, and will cause cognitive dissonance and stress.  \nIt\u2019s simply: \u201cWomen and men are meant to get together. I\u2019m a man. Therefore, women are already attracted to me on some baseline level.\u201d  \nThat\u2019s not a hard frame to maintain. It doesn\u2019t stretch the truth. It doesn\u2019t cause cognitive dissonance.  \nAnd therefore it\u2019s MUCH MORE RESILIENT in the face of tests and resistance \u2014 which is the most CRITICAL element to getting the hottest  girls.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**18\\. Cultivate a \u201creality distortion field\u201d**  \nIn order to do this, you must fully INTERNALIZE the \u201cI am enough\u201d belief system.  \nUnderstanding it in theory isn\u2019t enough. You have to feel it with your whole \u201cmass\u201d. You have to believe it with total, unquestioning, brainwashed conviction.  \nThe more you think about the idea that there\u2019s no reason you\u2019re not enough, the more it will feel \u201ctrue\u201d. (Things become true to us through repetition, not through logic.)  \nUse self-hypnosis if necessary. Find every reason you can to support the belief that you\u2019re enough, while cultivating \u201cdeliberate blindness\u201d to anything that contradicts it.  \nDon\u2019t be a slave to logic. Make logic a slave to you. This is how you cultivate a \u201creality distortion field\u201d.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n---------\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**PART 3: HOW TO MAKE WOMEN HORNY BY PASSING THEIR TESTS**  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**19\\. Enduring tests = building attraction**  \nWhen you approach a woman, she immediately starts testing you. By passing her tests, you demonstrate that your frame is stronger than hers. This makes her horny for you.  \nWomen are wired in such a way that they can\u2019t become wet for a man unless he\u2019s overcome some kind of *resistance* to get her.   Hence, tests actually help you to seduce her. You want her to test you. The more tests you endure, the faster she\u2019ll sleep with you.  \nWhen a girl is so into you that she doesn\u2019t test you, this is how you end up on a 3rd date with a woman who still won\u2019t put out.  \nTests are your friend.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**20\\. Passing tests is where ALL attraction is ultimately generated.**  \nAttraction is NOT generated by pickup lines and witty comebacks.  \nAttraction is NOT generated by manipulation techniques.  \nAttraction is NOT generated by looks or money.  \nAll of these things WILL increase your probabilities of getting laid, and make your game smoother and more streamlined.  \nBut they\u2019re NOT what builds ATTRACTION.  \nThe one and ONLY thing that builds attraction is ENDURING A WOMAN\u2019S TESTS.  \nThe reason for this is obvious when you think about it:  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**21\\. Enduring her tests = ability to overcome adversity = GOOD GENES**  \nWomen have to see you have a strong frame, because otherwise they have no confidence that you\u2019ll be able to protect them and remain calm in the face of danger.  \nAnd the ONLY way they can figure out if you have strong frame is by testing you, being bitchy, insulting you, brushing you off, ignoring you, etc.  \nThat might seem \u201cunfair\u201d to you.  \nBut if you can\u2019t handle the abuse from some blonde chick in a bar, how the fuck are you going to handle beating a 7ft tall man to death with your bare hands when he and his tribe invade your village and try to gang-rape your girl?  \nThink about it.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**22\\. Women aren\u2019t built for Starbucks. They\u2019re built for the African savannah.**  \nWomen aren\u2019t built for the modern world. They\u2019re built for nature, red in tooth and claw.  \nIf you understand that, you\u2019ll do things differently. You won\u2019t take it so personally when you approach a girl and she tries to destroy you.  \nIt\u2019s necessary.  \nHot women aren\u2019t acting bitchy to you because of feminism. They\u2019re acting bitchy to you because they WANT to fuck you \u2014 but they can only do so after they\u2019ve proved that you have a stronger frame than they do.  \nThis is instinctual. It\u2019s part of the natural order.  \nInnate female bitchiness existed long before feminism. Testing men who approach them is encoded into female DNA.  \nWhen you get bitter at hot women for testing you, you\u2019re being just as anti-nature as feminists themselves.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**23\\. Eliminate self-destructive beliefs**  \nThere\u2019s a common myth in the seduction community that a girl who acts \u201cbitchy\u201d to your approach is fundamentally flawed and therefore \u201cnot worth pursuing\u201d.  \nThis is totally ludicrous.  \nIn fact, it\u2019s just an incidence of \u201csour grapes\u201d \u2014 cognitive games we play with ourselves to rationalize that the grapes we can\u2019t reach are sour.  \nThe reality is that if a girl has ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER, then she will test you hard during your first approach.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**24\\. Embrace tests**  \nDo you want a woman who says yes to every cock who comes along without putting up the slightest resistance?  \nOr do you want a woman who actually DISCRIMINATES among men based on their value \u2014 and who CHOSE YOU over hundreds of other suitors because you had the highest value?  \nIf you\u2019re a normal, healthy man, you want the second woman \u2014 and that means you must LOGICALLY EXPECT her to test you hard, and to test you with everything she\u2019s got.  \nAnd you must not only expect tests, but APPRECIATE them.  \nYou LIKE it when a girl acts bitchy on your approach. It means that if you settle down with her, she\u2019s likely to act bitchy to OTHER GUYS who approach her, scaring them away.  \nThe higher a woman\u2019s value (in looks and character), the harder she will test you by ACTING \u201cboring\u201d and \u201cbitchy\u201d. This is the way it is and will be. This way and not some other way.  \nLuckily, passing tests is the fastest way to create arousal and horniness. This means that, paradoxically, the hottest women are often the easiest to seduce if you know how to pass their tests.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**THE TWO CATEGORIES OF \u201cTESTS\u201d HOT GIRLS WILL GIVE YOU, AND HOW TO PASS THEM**  \nWomen will give you two types of tests \u2014 active tests and passive tests.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**25\\. Active tests**  \nActive tests are covered frequently in PUA literature.  \nWhen a woman insults you, belittles you, mocks you, or says something provocative to get a reaction \u2014 these are all examples of active tests.  \nCommon \u201cbrush-off\u201d lines like telling you she has a boyfriend, saying you\u2019re a nice guy, telling you LJBF \u2014 these are also active tests.  \nI won\u2019t talk much about passing active tests as this material has already been done to death in the redpill\/PUA world. (Just look up anything on \u201cshit tests\u201d.)  \nSuffice to say, the best way to pass active tests is to either:  \na. Agree and amplify.  \nb. Ignore the test and continue as if you didn\u2019t even hear it.  \nGenerally speaking, getting active tests is VERY GOOD. If the girl\u2019s actively testing you, it means she\u2019s definitely interested. It\u2019s also a very easy way to demonstrate your strength of frame by being a charming asshole in response.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**26\\. How to get past her \u201cbitch shield\u201d persona and into her knickers: recognize and endure passive tests**  \nBut there is another type of test, which is MUCH more important to understand.  \nThis is the PASSIVE TEST. This is almost NEVER covered by PUA\/redpill literature \u2014 yet these tests are actually the most COMMON you\u2019ll encounter, particularly when dealing with 9s and 10s.  \nPassive testing happens when you approach a girl and she appears to be INDIFFERENT, BORED, or ALOOF.  \n\u201cResting bitch face\u201d is a passive test. Giving you only one word answers is a passive test.  \nAnd \u2014 my favorite \u2014 when you go to approach a hot girl and she looks at you with a face of half-disgust, half-horror, and runs away.  \nUtterly BRUTAL as it seems \u2014 yes, even THAT is a test.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**27\\. Don\u2019t confuse passive tests with \u201crejection\u201d**  \n99% of guys interpret passive tests as REJECTION. Even natural alphas do.  \nAnd that\u2019s totally understandable.  \nI mean, it makes sense right?  \nIf you approach a stunner and she takes one look at you before making a \u201ccreeped out\u201d face to her friend, and then they run away \u2014 that\u2019s obviously a rejection, right?  \nWell, what if I told you that at least half the women I\u2019ve slept with in my life reacted like that (or similarly badly) when I approached them?  \nHere\u2019s a particularly good example:  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**28\\. \u201cRejection\u201d is not rejection**  \nThere was this girl I went to college with. Brunette, hot, did modeling work in her spare time, socially was one step down from a \u201cminor celebrity\u201d in my city.  \nProbably one of the 10 or 15 hottest girls in my college.  \nI always wanted to fuck this girl, because she seemed smart and interesting as well as just hot. But I rarely saw her around.  \nOne day she passed me in the stairwell, and I thought \u201cthis is probably the only chance I\u2019m ever going to get\u201d.  \nSo I approached her and blurted. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Mike\u201d. Good eye contact. Held my hand out to shake hers. Whatever.  \nShe looked at me like I had leprosy.  \nI mean, she literally RECOILED. Her eyes went wide in horror, as if I was trying to infect her with AIDS.  \nShe shook my hand limply and muttered some social nicety back, then ran away swiftly.  \nWOW\u2026 Now THAT\u2019S a rejection, right?  \nWell, the story has an addendum. That woman is now my girlfriend. Has been for three years. She\u2019ll probably be the mother of my children.  \nSo what\u2019s going on here?  \nIf she was attracted to me (which she later told me she was), why did she appear to \u201creject\u201d me?  \nAnswering this question is the THE KEY to mastering all of game and social dynamics. You ready?  \nOk, here we go:  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**29\\. You are TOO HIGH VALUE**  \nYes, you read that correctly.  \nWhen you\u2019re getting \u201crejected\u201d by girls, it\u2019s because YOU\u2019RE TOO HIGH VALUE FOR THEM, and it makes them nervous and self-conscious.  \nStay with me here. I know this sounds paradoxical, but try to grasp it.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**30\\. Women are nervous around you**  \nWhen you approach a woman out of the blue, it demonstrates a LOT of value. More than you probably realize.  \nThis is because 97% of guys DON\u2019T APPROACH AT ALL. (Those who do are usually drunk and sloppy.)  \nThis means that if you\u2019re an average to fair looking guy, and you cold approach a girl, you\u2019ve just put yourself in the top 3% of men in terms of confidence.  \nIn other words, she is going to naturally ASSUME that you are an alpha male (whether this is true or not).  \nThis makes her NERVOUS and SELF-CONSCIOUS. She\u2019s ill at ease around you because she wants to make a good impression.  \nSo she tries to act \u201ccool\u201d, \u201caloof\u201d, and \u201cstandoffish\u201d\u2026 because she feels awkward.  \nShe says bitchy things\u2026 because she can\u2019t think of anything else to say.  \nShe run aways\u2026 because she feels anxious around you and doesn\u2019t know what to do next.  \nIn other words: you\u2019re coming across as TOO HIGH VALUE.  \nWomen are nervous around you. Be patient with them!  \nDumb yourself down. Hold frame, tease them, keep smiling warmly.  \nEventually they\u2019ll open up and start laughing, flirting back, and ultimately get turned on by the fact that you out-framed them in a way no other man ever has.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n---------\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**BONUS:  THE 6 MOST COMMON TESTS HOT GIRLS WILL GIVE YOU AND HOW TO PASS THEM IN A WAY THAT BUILDS ATTRACTION**  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**#1\\. You approach her, say hi, and she makes a weird face, or pretends to ignore you.**  \nSimply keep talking as if you expect her to talk back. She\u2019s nervous and self-conscious and *doesn\u2019t know what to say*. That\u2019s why she\u2019s acting \u201cbitchy\u201d \u2014 you\u2019re too high value for her and she feels anxious, causing her to try to act cool.  \nDon\u2019t react to her. Keep your body language open and relaxed. Warm smile, unwavering eye contact. Keep talking. Eventually she\u2019ll start talking back and responding positively.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**#2\\. You\u2019re talking to a girl and she acts indifferent or aloof, only gives you one word answers, or keeps looking off into the distance**  \nAgain, you simply have to ENDURE IT. Keep talking, keep being playful. Teasing her a little bit never hurts either. \u201cAre you this charming with all the guys?\u201d \u201cThis bitchy cheerleader persona you\u2019re putting on is really turning me on, please keep it going ;-)\u201d  \nWhen she sees you\u2019re not going to go away so easily, her frame will crack. She\u2019ll start to smile. Attraction.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**#3\\. You\u2019re talking to a girl and she leaves to go to the bathroom, says \u201cI have to go find my friends\u201d, or runs away for no apparent reason.**  \nLet her go. Then re-approach her later. I can\u2019t tell you how many girls have run off on me, then I approach them half an hour later and they\u2019re like \u201cOh it\u2019s you!\u201d and then we hook up.  \nWhy do women leave? Again, they\u2019re NERVOUS.  \nHave you ever approached a hot girl and things were going TOO WELL? The girl is smiling and laughing\u2026. she\u2019s responding well\u2026 and\u2026. you freak out! You don\u2019t know what else to do, but you don\u2019t want to fuck it up, so you leave set!  \nGIRLS DO THIS TOO. Women will \u201crun out of things to say\u201d and run away because they\u2019re nervous and overwhelmed by being in a high value person\u2019s presence, same as guys will.  \nLet her go, then re-approach her next time you see her.  \nShe will respond extremely well 90% of the time in my experience. She\u2019ll literally be GRATEFUL to you that you gave her another chance. Women have told me this explicitly.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**#4\\. If you\u2019re talking to a girl and she tells you outright that you should leave, or says \u201cwell, you should go back to your friends\u201d, \u201cit was nice meeting you\u201d, etc.**  \nSmile, nod, agree, and then continue talking to her as if she said nothing. Never leave set because a girl tells you to.  \nSHE can walk away if she wants. She has that right.  \nBut in a public space like a bar or nightclub, you\u2019re well within your rights to talk to whoever you want.  \nIt\u2019s Saturday night. It\u2019s a social environment. You\u2019re mixing with people.  \nYou\u2019re free to talk to whoever you want, and she\u2019s free to walk away at any time.  \nBut if she tells YOU to leave, it\u2019s simply a test of your frame. She wants to see that you won\u2019t buckle under social pressure.  \nPass the test by ignoring it. If she tells you to leave again, look her in the eye with a sly smile and say \u201cYou\u2019re free to go if you want to.\u201d  \nHer eyes will light up and she\u2019ll punch you in the arm. Pussy dampening commences.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**#5\\. You\u2019re talking to a woman and there\u2019s an uncomfortably long lull in the conversation.**  \nStare into her left pupil while saying nothing. Instant sexual tension.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**#6\\. You approach a woman, or a group of women, and they attempt to mock or belittle you.**  \nThey\u2019re nervous around you because you\u2019re the alpha male in the environment. (As demonstrated by the fact that you approached.)  \nThey feel uncomfortable in your presence because you\u2019re high value, and so they\u2019re trying to maintain frame by making nervous jokes.  \nSmile, nod, agree, and keep talking to them AS IF they were being perfectly nice to you. If you act like they\u2019re being civil, eventually their frame will buckle to yours and they actually WILL begin to act civil.  \nThat\u2019s the nature of having a stronger frame: you create reality. Other people adjust themselves to it.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n---------\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**TL;DR**  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**1\\.** Women value you because you have a STRONGER FRAME than them. That\u2019s all.  \n**2\\.** To figure out if you\u2019ve got a strong frame, women test you. These tests come in the form of indifference, bitchiness, aloofness, personal insults, etc.  \n**3\\.** You don\u2019t have to do much to pass these tests. You just have to ENDURE them, keep talking to her, teasing her a little and being normal. Over time, her frame will buckle and she\u2019ll become aroused by you because she sees you have a strong frame that can\u2019t be pushed around.  \n**4\\.** Attraction is a passive, not an active process. You attract hot girls by outframing them. You outframe them by enduring their tests without it breaking your frame. Eventually they \u201cbuckle\u201d to you and become wet, laugh at your jokes, ask you what you\u2019re doing later, etc. Then you can take her hand and lead her to the sex location and she\u2019ll be compliant.  \n**5\\.** The hotter the woman, the harsher will be her tests. Paradoxically, this can actually make hotter women easier to attract, because if you can endure her tests you stand out massively from other guys. Compare to an average girl: her tests won\u2019t be as hard, so you have to pass more of them and spend more time with her before she can see you\u2019re strong  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n---------\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**If you\u2019ve found this guide helpful, you might like my blog.

Anton Chigurh (Bardem) and Llewellyn Moss (Brolin) are supporting characters who's only real purpose is instrumental to the plot.\n\nThe whole movie, Ed Bell is trying to figure out why the young folk (at least a generation younger than himself) are like the way they are. He doesn't understand why they are obsessed with money, he doesn't understand why they are so violent and bloodthirsty. \n\nWhen Ed comes to realisation in his own head as to why this is, the plot with Llewellyn and Chigurh ends as abruptly as it started, because the story line has served it's purpose.\n\nThe realisation that Ed comes to is revealed at the very end of the film, with the story about the dream he had with his father going on up ahead, and not knowing what he was doing. His father didn't understand Ed, and Ed didn't understand his father. Ed is now at the point in his life where he is in his father's position.\n\nEd realises, quite literally, that it's No Country For Old Men.\n\nKeep in mind that this is an almost superficial explanation of the film and it's themes, I decided to keep it concise because I could literally be here for hours typing my response. I also strongly recommend the book by Cormac McCarthy.\n\nedit: words",

        "body": "Alright, sorry about the delay. I was too busy celebrating the New Year. ;) I hope you're still checking in on this account.\n\nAnyway, I think I have a bit of a unique perspective. I've seen MIT admissions from the perspective of the applicant, a student, a teacher, and now as an alumnus conducting interviews of prospective students. The fact that you mentioned MIT specifically really made me feel like I should take the time to produce a good response!\n\nI wanted to start by writing out standard admissions advice (e.g. no one thing like SAT scores will keep you from being admitted, etc.). While all that is true, the problem you're dealing with is so much bigger than that. The problem you're coming up against is one I've seen so many of my fellow students encounter. If I could set up a wavy-fade flashback, I'd show you my freshman year.\n\nI moved into one of the dorms at MIT thinking I was hot shit. I had, after all, just gotten into MIT. And beyond that, I had tested out of the freshman calculus and physics classes, meaning that I was able to start math \"a year\" ahead in differential equations and start with the advanced version of the physics 2 class we have. Registration went by easy enough and I was pleased with my decisions.\n\nTerm rolled in and I was getting crushed. I wasn't the greatest student in high school, and whenever I got poor grades I would explain them away by saying I just didn't care or I was too busy or too unmotivated or (more often than not) just cared about something else. It didn't help that I had good test performance which fed my ego and let me think I was smarter than everyone else, just relatively unmotivated. I had grossly underestimated MIT, and was left feeling so dumb.\n\nI had the fortune of living next to a bright guy, R. R. was an advanced student, to say the least. He was a sophomore, but was already taking the most advanced graduate math classes. He came into MIT and tested out of calculus, multivariable calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, real analysis (notoriously the most difficult math class at MIT), and a slew of other math courses. And to top it all off, he was attractive, engaging, sociable, and generally had no faults that would make him mortal.\n\nI suffered through half a semester of differential equations before my pride let me go to R. for help. And sure enough, he took my textbook for a night to review the material (he couldn't remember it all from third grade), and then he walked me through my difficulties and coached me. I ended up pulling a B+ at the end of a semester and avoiding that train wreck. The thing is, nothing he taught me involved raw brainpower. The more I learned the more I realized that the bulk of his intelligence and his performance just came from study and practice, and that the had amassed a large artillery of intellectual and mathematical tools that he had learned and trained to call upon. He showed me some of those tools, but what I really ended up learning was how to go about finding, building, and refining my own set of cognitive tools. I admired R., and I looked up to him, and while I doubt I will ever compete with his genius, I recognize that it's because of a relative lack of my conviction and an excess of his, not some accident of genetics.\n\nIt's easy to trick ourselves into thinking that \"being smart\" is what determines our performance. In so many ways, it's the easiest possible explanation because it demands so little of us and immediately explains away our failings. You are facing this tension without recognizing it. You are blaming your intelligence in the first two paragraphs but you undermine yourself by saying you received good grades you didn't deserve. You recognize your lack of motivation as a factor in your lack of extracurricular activities but not in your SAT scores (fun fact: the variable that correlates most strongly to SAT performance is hours of studying for the SATs). Your very last statement could just as well apply to your entire post: \n\n> But none of this has to do with my intelligence; I'm just rambling.\n\nYou got A's because you studied or because the classes were easy. You got a B probably because you were so used to understanding things that you didn't know how to deal with something that didn't come so easily. I'm guessing that early on you built the cognitive and intellectual tools to rapidly acquire and process new information, but that you've relied on those tools so much you never really developed a good set of tools for what to do when those failed. This is what happened to me, but I didn't figure it out until after I got crushed by my first semester of college. I need to ask you, has anyone ever taken the time to teach you how to study? And separately, have you learned how to study on your own in the absence of a teacher or curriculum? These are the most valuable tools you can acquire because they are the tools you will use to develop more powerful and more insightful tools. It only snowballs from there until you become like R. \n\nMIT has an almost 97% graduation rate. That means that most of the people who get in, get through. Do you know what separates the 3% that didn't from the rest that do? I do. I've seen it so many times, and it almost happened to me. Very few people get through four years of MIT with such piss-poor performance that they don't graduate. In fact, I can't think of a single one off the top of my head. People fail to graduate from MIT because they come in, encounter problems that are harder than anything they've had to do before, and not knowing how to look for help or how to go about wrestling those problems, burn out. The students that are successful look at that challenge, wrestle with feelings of inadequacy and stupidity, and begin to take steps hiking that mountain, knowing that bruised pride is a small price to pay for getting to see the view from the top. They ask for help, they acknowledge their inadequacies. They don't blame their lack of intelligence, they blame their lack of motivation. I was lucky that I had someone to show me how to look for that motivation, and I'm hoping that I can be that person for you in some small capacity over the Internet. I was able to recover from my freshman year and go on to be very successful in my studies, even serving as a TA for my fellow students. When I was a senior, I would sit down with the freshmen in my dorm and show them the same things that had been shown to me, and I would watch them struggle with the same feelings, and overcome them. By the time I graduated MIT, I had become the person I looked up to when I first got in.\n\nYou're so young, way too young to be worried about not being smart enough. Until you're so old you start going senile, you have the opportunity to make yourself \"smarter.\" And I put that in quotes because \"smart\" is really just a way of saying \"has invested so much time and sweat that you make it look effortless.\" You feel like you are burnt out or that you are on the verge of burning out, but in reality you are on the verge of *deciding* whether or not you will burn out. It's scary to acknowledge that it's a decision because it puts the onus on you to to do something about it, but it's *empowering* because it means *there is something you can do about it*.\n\nSo *do it.*\n\n\n--------------\n**EDIT** Did not expect this to blow up like it has! I'm terribly sorry I only got back to checking it so late. I'll make it a point to sit down sometime in the next few days and bang out the responses all your great questions and comments deserve. Until then, I'm glad I could share this story with so many people.",

The US military has such a clear dominance on military technology, education, and capabilities it's not even funny.\n\n* [The US is responsible for 41% of global military expenditures.](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures) That's right the US is responsible for almost half of the world's military expenditures.\n\n* [The US has the second largest active military in the world after China.](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel) This is complemented by the US's air and naval forces. Speaking of which:\n\n* [The US has the most aircraft carriers in the world BY FAR at 10.](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_aircraft_carriers_in_service) Second place is Italy with 2. **The US has as many carriers in service as the rest of the world.** Think of each one as a mobile air force base. These are all Nimitz-class carriers, meaning they are a class of super-carriers that can hold about 90 planes each, travel at around 30 knots, and house 2 nuclear reactors for propulsion. **These motherfuckers can go over 20 years without refueling!** That means the US has 10 mobile air force bases that essentially never rests. The US is the undisputed Queen Bitch of the seas.\n\nAnd that's only the carriers. Globally, there are 28 Cruisers and 150 Destroyers. [The US owns 22 of those Cruisers and 62 of those Destroyers.](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_level_of_military_equipment)\n\n* The US has the biggest air force, bar none. Technologically, the Russians have come out with an almost equivalent air fighter but the US has a much larger air force and the logistical capability to fight anywhere efficiently.\n\n* As if all these conventional weapons aren't enough, the US's nuclear capabilities are mind-boggling. Everyone knows the US and Russia generally have the same amount of nuclear weapons (around 5,000) but the US's delivery systems are unparalleled. The US holds 71 of 134 total nuclear powered submarines in the world. \n\nOut of these 71, 18 are Ohio-class. These are capable of holding 24 Trident SLBM missiles that each hold up to 8 MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) nuclear warheads. Each of these MIRV warheads hold a firepower of 100 kilotons of TNT. **That means each of these subs could hold 24 missiles that can each separate into 8 nuclear warheads, totaling 192 warheads, each with a range of 4,600 miles. That means a sub off of NYC could hit Anchorage. You read that right. We essentially have 18 mobile nuclear launch bases that can move underwater.**\n\nSay there is knowledge of an impending nuclear attack by, say, North Korea. Suppose that US satellites saw North Koreans fueling the missiles and that they were going to launch a warhead. Before they were even done fueling, I am sure the US would have a few subs in the area and be capable of independently targeting each major city and military site in North Korea and nuking them. If they wanted to.\n\nTL:DR The US is Queen Bitch of the world. Militarily.",

We are much better off than we were just as the millennium dawned. \n\nHowever, most significant, far-reaching changes need a non-partisan Govt. policy to provide direction. While that is somewhat present at the Center, a lot of states still remain mired in divisive, reactionary politics centered on the whole \"us vs them\". Even parties which came in with a premise of avoiding the usual routine are now getting stuck in the system\n\nWhat has happened so far is India seems like a machine with its internal out of place, a jarring, clanking monstrosity instead of a well maintained system. This manifests itself in a lot of unsightly ways that do nothing but hold us back from advancing as a nation. \n\n\n*  At the city level, its migrants vs long-time residents. \n\n* At the state, its state vs state for resource allocation and linguistic barriers serving to create more bigotry.\n\n* At the national level, its us vs. them in terms of religious and other communal boundaries. But ultimately, there are so many internal conflicts that we ourselves are holding each other back from going forward. \n\n\nAll of us are stuck in a 9-5 grind with sharmaji-ka-beta aspirations. And it ends there. No hope for a better India, just a better tomorrow for us individually. Eventually all this will change, with a increasing number of people having access to the internet and thus, information. But right now, as private citizens, what can we do to make a difference for a better tomorrow for us as a collective?",

I went along and we ended up in total whiteout, \"inadvertant IMC\" conditions.  Coulda died.  Ended up landing 150 miles from home staying in a days inn where 75% of rooms rented by pimps.\n\n2) Fly down the coast to Florida?  Sure.  End up scud running the coast of Maryland, almost hitting a ferris wheel, had to get special clearance through military space (wallops!) to maintain marginal at best VFR.\n\n3) flying across florida.  9 AM is great no problems, but T-Storms pop around mid day like clockwork.  Dude refuses to get up\/motivate to do the flight early.  End up taking off around 11:30 AM.  End up under Orlando's class B airspace, heavies above and the best part?  We get caught in an updraft, almost stall out and spend 40 mins weaving through thunder heads \"because we have onboard weather\"\n\n4) Again, drags his feet for on-time departure.  End up at airport and he wants to go go go.  Lightning strikes on the field and reported downbursts in the vicinity.  But it stops raining and he's all - \"lets go.\"  He Jawboned tower into Taxiing us out when they didn't want.  Then watched a tree at one end of the airport get zapped from the cockpit before tower chased us back to the FBO saying \"don't let me hear from you for at least two hours\"\n\nI spent a ton of money to get my pilots license and fly with a friend who is lucky enough to have a plane.   Decided I prefer living.  Probably won't use my license again until i hit the lottery.  But i'm alive after all his shenanigans (and my own stupidity not standing up for proper safety and ADM) and thats probably used up all my odds-beating karma.  \n\nEdit: speling and a werd.",

        "body": "Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold! :D\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re boring.\n\nMaybe no one\u2019s ever told you that but you sometimes get a sinking feeling in your stomach that hints at it. Or maybe someone has told you you\u2019re boring and it makes you feel like a worthless piece of ####.\n\nYou want to be interesting and fun, but you\u2019re trapped in the prison of your limited social skills.\n\n\u2026 But what makes you so boring?\n\nYou do.\n\nThe prison bars are made of your own negative beliefs and you can\u2019t seem to squeeze through them. If there\u2019s one thing you\u2019re good at it\u2019s tricking yourself into believing that you suck. How fun. Though the fact that you did this to yourself is actually good news. You can turn it around.\n\n**HOW YOU STARTED BEING BORING**\n\nOnce upon a time, when you were about 3-feet tall, you were all about fun. You were an explorer learning to navigate your world and nothing was off-limits.\n\nYou burnt your hand on the stove. It didn\u2019t stop you from playing with fire.\n\nThen along came social rules and the idea that you were \u201csupposed to\u201d behave in certain ways in certain situations. You learned that there were consequences to your actions and doubt replaced abandon. The world became more complicated than it had previously seemed.\n\nTake Little Pete for instance. At 3-feet Little Pete liked to run around the house naked playing cowboys and indians, screaming his lungs out. He didn\u2019t give a shit.\n\nAt 4-feet Little Pete had his first crush. We\u2019ll call her Lacey. Their class was putting on a dance for the school and the teacher asked the boys to choose their partners.\n\nThe problem was that Lacey already had a boyfriend, or at least a boy she held hands with at lunchtime (the little turdburger!). But when Miss Hudson told the girls that they had to say yes to the first boy who asked to be their dance partner Little Pete saw his opportunity. None of the other boys moved. Little Pete pounced! Lacey said \u2018no\u2019 but Miss Hudson sealed the deal.\n\nThey danced together for the weeks that followed and, slowly but surely, he won Lacey over. She told him she liked him.\n\nLittle Pete didn\u2019t know what to do in this foreign scenario so every day he sent his best friend to ask Lacey if she still liked him. That was the extent of his contact with Lacey. She said yes for 3 days then changed her mind.\n\nLittle Pete was devastated. He developed a fear of talking to girls which dragged on until he was 18.\n\nAfter a few more run-ins with \u201cthe consequences of his actions\u201d he stopped taking chances. He made his decisions based on what people would think of him. He agreed with opinions, he avoided stepping on toes, he suppressed his desires. He was good little boring boy.\n\nThere was a time when you too used to act first, think later. Not anymore. Now you worry about all of the negative & far-fetched possible outcomes that your mind can conjure up, and they\u2019re usually enough to convince you to be boring.\n\nIt goes something like this in an uncertain situation:\n\n**THE BORING PROCESS (CODENAME: BORING BORIS)**\n\nTRIGGER:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to do.\"\n\n1. Do I have to do something (or say something)?\nNo: Do nothing. Play it safe.\nYes: Go to step 2.\n\n2. What should I do?\nOption 1 \u2014 What is the polite thing to do?\nOption 2 \u2014 What do I think is normal in this situation?\nOption 3 \u2014 What is the easiest (least scary) thing for me to do?\n\n3. Choose an option and act.\n\nYou\u2019ve run this process over and over again. You said 'no' to your inner explorer. Congratulations, you made yourself boring.\n\nBut the good news is it\u2019s not you that\u2019s boring. It\u2019s the boring shit you choose to do that\u2019s boring. And all it takes to stop being boring is to do something different.\n\n**WHY BEING BORING MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE CRAP**\n\nThere's a problem with the Boring Boris process: we designed it to keep us safe and we feel safest when we use it, but we feel like crap afterwards.\n\nMost people don\u2019t dislike us when we use Boring Boris because we put none of our self in our actions, hence there\u2019s nothing to dislike. They don\u2019t see us at all. We make ourselves easy to ignore.\n\n* If I do the polite thing I make no connection;\n* If I do what I think is normal I\u2019m not even copying a real person. I\u2019m copying a hypothetical average and turning myself into a characterless bore;\n* If I do the easiest (least scary) thing I\u2019m hiding as much of my self as possible. Only sharing what I have to. It\u2019s like taking out a hair clip when you lose at strip poker. Boring.\n\nIf you want people to actually like you you have to get naked, or at least show some skin \u2014 figuratively ;). Give them something to like. Put your self in your actions.\n\nYes, there\u2019s a risk in not being boring. Some people might not like what they see when you stop hiding, but their disapproval means nothing when you find the people who do like you. Those are the connections that will fuel you. Being truly accepted for the weird monkey that you are inside is the greatest feeling in the world.\n\nIt\u2019s a much bigger risk to be boring. You\u2019ll never make strong connections.\n\nImagine yourself in this situation: it\u2019s your first day at university. You\u2019re sitting in the lecture hall and you don\u2019t know anyone. Imagine the speaker asks for a volunteer to stand up and tell the class something that you did in the past week as an ice-breaker.\n\nDid you get a physical reaction to that last sentence? Lump in your throat, maybe? Are you unsure what to say?\n\nMost people in the class will go through a thought process that looks something like Boring Boris.\n\nTrigger:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to do.\"\n\nDo I have to do something (or say something)?\nNo: Do nothing. Play it safe. Hide.\n\nOr if they\u2019re singled out they take the easy option. They share nothing risky about themselves: \u201cI don\u2019t know... I did lots of things this week. Umm, I bought some textbooks.\"\n\nNot Felicity though.\n\nFelicity used to play it safe but now she's the first to put her hand up. She\u2019s a risk-taker. She doesn\u2019t mind looking foolish because she\u2019s learnt there\u2019s more to gain than there is to lose.\n\nYou might like Felicity or you might hate her, but would you say she\u2019s boring? Read on and compare.\n\n**THE FUN PROCESS (CODENAME: \"FUCK IT\" FELICITY)**\n\nHow do we put our self in our actions to become more fun? More interesting?\n\nWe replace the \u2018should\u2019 in Boring Boris with \u2018want\u2019. We stop reacting and start creating. It looks like this:\n\nTrigger:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to do.\"\n\n1. What do I want to do?\nOption 1 \u2014 What experience do I want to create for myself?\nOption 2 \u2014 What gets me excited?\nOption 3 \u2014 What am I afraid of doing, that at least part of me wants to do?\n\n2. Choose an option and act.\n\nFelicity\u2019s heart is racing from what she\u2019s about to say. She\u2019s scared but she wants to connect, so she seizes this opportunity to share with the class. Because fuck it.\n\n\u201cI levelled up my Mage in World of Warcraft and my guild is raiding a dungeon tonight! If anyone here plays WoW come say hi.\"\n\nNow everyone in the class knows something about \u201cFuck it\u201d Felicity. They have something they can talk to her about. They might even feel a bit closer to her. She certainly didn't bore them.\n\nMeanwhile no one knows anything about Boring Boris.\n\n**STOP BEING BORING**\n\nBecoming interesting can be scary at first. But you want it. Do you know the combination of fear and desire that I\u2019m talking about? That\u2019s your green light. That\u2019s your brightly-lit path away from boring.\n\nFelicity didn\u2019t stop being boring because she was particularly interesting. She stopped being boring because she decided to \u201cget naked\u201d. Now she expresses her opinion, she steps on toes, she chases what she wants\u2026 and the funny thing is people love her for it. She\u2019s real.\n\nThe next time you\u2019re unsure what to do in a given situation, try running \u201cFuck it\u201d Felicity instead of Boring Boris. Start small, make mistakes and learn from them.\n\n**EXAMPLES**\n\nA real estate agent told me he wants to build trust with his clients. \"I'm not an average agent. I care about them and getting their home. I want them to know I'm the best agent and they can trust me with one of the biggest investments of their lives.\u201d He tries to connect with his clients but the majority of the time they give him one-word answers. The stress of trying to sell them a house gets in the way of connecting.\n\nBoring Boris would act the way he thinks a real estate agent \u201cshould\u201d act in this situation. He\u2019d make polite small talk and tell the clients how spacious the bedroom is and how much light the living room gets because the windows face east, where the sun rises.\n\n\u201cFuck it\u201d Felicity might say \u201cListen, before I show you some houses I want you to know that I actually care about you finding a home that makes you happy. Some agents just want to offload as many houses as possible but I can\u2019t do that... I\u2019d feel too guilty if I forced something on you. Plus I\u2019m a terrible liar. So I actually want to know what you like and what you don\u2019t like. If you promise to tell me, I\u2019ll promise to not pretend a crappy house is great for you.\"\n\nSomeone else I know has trouble connecting with people because he's too eager to connect. He says he has a weird personality and sense of humour so he resorts to polite conversation to play it safe\u2026 meaning he\u2019s essentially running the Boring Boris process. His conversations look like this:\n\nHim: Hey! How are you?\nThem: Good, how about yourself?\nHim: Pretty good.\nHim (in his head): (Okay what's next? \u2014 awkward silence)\nHim: Gloomy weather, eh? or What\u2019d you have for lunch?\n\n\u201cFuck it\u201d Felicity would make it personal. She might read the other person\u2019s body language and say \u201cHey, you look (happy\/focused\/full of energy\/excited\/chilled\/etc!). What\u2019s happening?\"\n\nEven if you read them wrong they\u2019ll appreciate that you\u2019ve taken the time to notice them. And now you can talk about what\u2019s really going on, instead of the weather. Try to avoid making negative observations like sad, tired, sick, etc. because it can make them self-conscious. You could put a more positive spin on it with something like \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been working hard.\u201d or \u201cYou look like you\u2019re deep in thought.\"\n\nIf they seem like they don\u2019t want to talk, because sometimes we all don\u2019t, you can follow it with \u201cAnyway, you look like you\u2019re on your way somewhere.\u201d or \u201cYou look like you\u2019re really busy.\u201d They\u2019ll appreciate you giving them an easy out and will remember how socially aware you are next time.\n\nSomeone else I know rarely shares things about himself because he feels like he\u2019s too boring or not good enough for his friends. He talks to his friends about football, wrestling and topics he thinks they want to talk about, because they\u2019re easy. He judges himself based on how interested they are in what he says, yet he puts no self in what he says. Textbook Boring Boris.\n\nIf you\u2019re scared to share something because you think \u201cit\u2019s too boring\u201d, you\u2019re probably wrong. Most things that are scary to share are actually rather interesting. People have similar fears. They can relate.\n\nWhen you share things that scare you people recognise that you\u2019ve trusted them enough to share something scary. They admire that you\u2019ve taken a risk for the benefit of connecting with them. You stop being boring, you become real.\n\nThat\u2019s why when \u201cFuck it\u201d Felicity feels like she\u2019s too boring she might say to her friends \u201cHey guys, how do you always come up with interesting things to say? Sometimes I think I\u2019m a bit boring.\" Because she\u2019s real. Be real.\n\nBoring Boris\u2019 fears come from low self-esteem or insecurity. We all have them to some degree. Applying \u201cFuck it\u201d Felicity\u2019s approach can help you change not just your outcomes, but also the root of the problem over time.\n\nIf you\u2019ve thought of a boring thing you do that you\u2019d like to change but you can\u2019t work out what \u201cFuck it\u201d Felicity\u2019s approach would be: subscribe to my email list below and reply to the welcome email. I\u2019ll help you work it out.\n\nNow go get back in touch with your inner 3-foot-tall explorer. Go play with fire.\n\nIf you want more actionable advice like this, get your daily dose of communication hacks and people skills [here](https:\/\/beardstrokings.com\/learn?utm_source=red-htngafboring).",

An engineer isn't *ever* going to spot you before the train closes that mile and he can apply the brakes. His viewing distance is shorter than that mile the train needs to stop.\n\nAnother thing about trains nowadays is that they are quiet. Railcars are designed to have the lowest friction coefficient possible to maintain efficiency and reduce strain on the locomotive's powerplant. If you are walking down a track, the vibrations of the train and the sound of the engine will not be felt before you do not have time to react. It is up to the engineer to remain vigilant enough to sound the horn.\n\nOn the topic of engineers, most people forget that trains are not inanimate machines. They are vehicles like cars and planes. If a car crash occurs and someone dies, the one who caused the crash will have to live with that for the rest of their life. The same goes for engineers; there is a real person inside that cab. Even if there was nothing they could do, horror stories of engineers with PTSD and suicides are commonplace. A saying in the industry is that it is only a matter of time before the average locomotive operator kills someone, and it is never of their own accord.\n\n**TL;DR** Trains are often fatally underestimated. Just stay out of the way.",

        "body": "While men and women are very different, one thing we have in common is that the majority of us are **terrible**. 90% of women are basic bitches whose lives revolve around Netflix, wine, shopping, and naps. But we often forget that 90% of men are fuckboys who have no vision beyond videogames, televised sports, smoking weed, and trying to keep their dicks slick. We fault women as boring and banal but too often neglect ourselves.\n\nThe kneejerk response is that we\u2019re all unplugged individuals. We\u2019re miles ahead of Joe Beta eating cheetohs on the couch. But the unfortunate truth is that TRP consists mainly of Reformed Betas, and chances are most of us spent high school and college locked in our rooms studying or playing video games; which in terms of cultivating individual character and force of personality is pretty fucking terrible. Without real life experience, too often these guys express themselves through pop-culture references and define themselves by the media they consume. They lack an original, self-actualized identity.\n\nAlmost every day I see newly unplugged guys wondering how they can become more interesting and make conversation. Most of TRP is pretty straightforward: lift, read, approach. There\u2019s an endless amount of information on how to lift weights, along with a wealth of resources in the sidebar on RP theory and game. But what do you do if you have the chiseled body and iron frame, but nothing inside? ***Many guys here already have rich and fulfilling lives. This post is not for you.*** This is for all the newbies who hit \/r\/asktrp wondering how to make friends. \n\n**Hobbies, interests, and experiences**\n\nThese three things make up the foundation of who we are. Women might be judged solely on how they look, but men are judged on WHAT THEY DO. *What do you do? What do you like to do? What have you already done? What do you plan on doing?* Either directly or indirectly, people will ask you these questions and you must have satisfactory answers. If the answer to all these questions is Xbox and jerking off then you\u2019re doing it wrong. \n\n**HOBBIES**\n\nThese are activities you do regularly with TANGIBLE results. \u201cPlaying videogames\u201d is not a hobby. Neither is watching sports, drinking beers, or hanging out with your bros. There is nothing inherently wrong with these activities, but in the end you haven\u2019t achieved anything substantial. We fault party girls for endlessly pursuing good times without contributing or developing anything. While lounging on the porch lacks the glamour and excitement of recreational drugs and club music, it\u2019s ultimately just as frivolous. Hobbies are more analogous to skills, rooted in pragmatism with tangible benefits. **Women don't worry about this because they are all born with a vital skill: SEX**\n\nIt is imperative that you cultivate several hobbies and work on them regularly. That is, at least once a week -- preferably more often -- you dedicate time towards the pursuit of each hobby. How many people do you know that \u201cplay guitar\u201d but haven\u2019t touched one in months if not years? If they even still own one.\n \nTo develop a well-rounded personality, you must pursue at least one hobby from each of the three cardinal spheres: **The Physical, The Creative, and The Mental**.\n\n**THE PHYSICAL**: These are activities that strengthen your body and increase your stamina. At least three times a week you should be engaging in a physical activity. The very minimum requirement is weightlifting, the quintessential \u201clift more\u201d of TRP. But often that\u2019s not enough. Every lame half-alpha out in the wild fucks around at the gym, and for top-tier guys a weightlifting regimen is all but mandatory. A true physical hobby goes beyond mere maintenance of your physique. These are activities like snowboarding, rock climbing, boxing, and cycling. Even conventional sports like basketball -- if you take it seriously. Pushing your body to its limits and developing your natural agility, power, and grace. We might not be chasing down mammoths any more but you can still be a hunter and warrior.\n \nIf it is your sole source of exercise then three times a week is mandatory. If it supplements weightlifting or calisthenics, then once a week is acceptable. It\u2019s not just about strengthening your body, but adding another layer to your personality. \u201cI\u2019m hitting the slopes over break. I just ran a marathon last weekend. Let\u2019s ball after work.\u201d You will have a hardness and appeal to you that most people lack. \n\n**THE CREATIVE**: These are activities that result in tangible pieces of aesthetic work. Drawing, painting, music, sculpture, singing, and so on. Most people believe that artistic ability is innate, but really it\u2019s a matter of practice and commitment. Just like lifting and game, there are myriad resources available for you to improve in the media of your choice. As with The Physical, creative hobbies need to be practiced at least three times a week. \n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that multiple times a week you need to painstakingly hew Greco-Roman deities from living marble. Just as there are light and heavy workouts, there are smaller and larger sessions. For example, I\u2019m a painter. I dedicate a single day during the week in which I go to the studio, turn my phone off, and spend a few hours painting. The rest of the week I just work in my sketchbook: drawing, sketching, and generally brainstorming. Likewise, maybe you only go to a voice coach once a week, but the rest of the time you practice your scales at home. Not every session is monumental, but you consistently make progress. If you can commit to those three weekly sessions, you\u2019ll be surprised at how quickly you improve and how proficient you become. If you spend money on private lessons or take a class at the local college you\u2019ll progress even faster, with the bonus of meeting young liberal females ;)\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a Renaissance artist to satisfy this hobby. Creative writing and poetry are equally excellent. Woodworking is rustic and timeless. Photography and graphic design are also viable options that are more modern and accessible, although significant effort is required to elevate yourself above the many amateurs.\n\n**THE MENTAL**: Another word for this sphere would be The Technical or The Intellectual. The Physical will strengthen your body and The Creative will refine your aesthetic, but you need to challenge your mind in order to complete the trinity. There are overlaps between Mental hobbies and Interests (which I will mention shortly), but remember that the defining aspect of a hobby is that it provides tangible benefit. While reading about history and playing chess are certainly intellectual pursuits, ultimately you don\u2019t achieve much besides knowing more about history and getting better at chess.\n\nMental hobbies are things such as coding, mechanics, and foreign languages. They can be financial pursuits such as real estate or managing a business. On a more Machiavellian level, it can even include human psychology and manipulation. They all require intelligence, study, and practice, but are useful and applicable. You can build your own website or design a new app. Save hundreds of dollars maintaining your own vehicle. TRP often recommends travel; consider how much more autonomous you will be and how much richer your experience when you have multiple means of communication at your disposal. Out of the three spheres, Mental hobbies most directly translate into utility and profit. \n\n***\n\nThese categories are not set in stone. There is plenty of overlap between the spheres. Dance blends the physical and the creative. Cooking and baking blend the creative and mental. Martial arts combine the mental and physical. **Even something as mundane as gardening contains elements from all three areas**. The key is to become a well-rounded individual who can contribute in multiple ways. \n\n**INTERESTS**\n\nInterests and hobbies are often confused. While there are similarities, the main difference is that interests are pursued on their own merit. You engage in them solely because of their appeal to you. Hobbies are constrained through their practical application, but interests are far more open ended. However, most interests have zero practicality; you need a different mindset when you pursue interests versus hobbies.\n\nThe \"point\" of having diverse interests is allowing you to contribute to conversations. That\u2019s it. Yes you can pull the sitcom routine and try to memorize various trivia on a subject so you can fake expertise, but your conversations will be far more natural, organic, and fulfilling if you have real knowledge of whatever topic you are discussing. *To be an interesting person you need to discuss interesting things; to discuss interesting things you need to have knowledge on interesting things.*\n\nWhat do you do for fun? What interests or excites you? Answering these questions is crucial to determining what you want to pursue. Nature and the outdoors. Punk rock. Floral arrangement. Archaeology. Tarot readings. Classic literature. Tropical fish. Horror movies. Modern art. Taxidermy. Deep house. American history. Board games. Tantric philosophy. Magic tricks. Rock collecting. German expressionism. Astronomy. Hog futures. Interior design. **Your options are endless**. This is such a simple and basic concept but many people lack the basic desire to broaden their horizons. Ask your plates about *any* of these topics and watch their eyes glaze over. \n\nTake initiative and pursue your interests actively. You can\u2019t passively sit through life waiting for opportunities to explore. Just like anything else on TRP, read, learn, and spend time on them.  If you don\u2019t know where to begin, don\u2019t forget that any of the hobbies mentioned in the previous section are automatic interests. They naturally lend themselves to other areas of knowledge. If you\u2019re a cyclist, then you already know about cycling. You can discuss different bikes, routes, and maintenance, but it\u2019s so easy to expand from cycling into environmental impact, public transit, kinesiology, health benefits, city planning, triathlons, and mechanics.\n\nHowever, not all interests are created equal. Videogames get a lot of shit on TRP, but videogames are a legitimate interest. You can spend time and money on them, you can discuss them, and they bring enjoyment to your life. But when men on TRP talk shit about videogames, it comes from a place of truth. For practical purposes, **NO** women want to hear you talk about videogames. **None of them. Ever**. What you do on your own time is your business. If they help you unwind, God bless. But understand that certain things have a negative connotation that you may want to distance yourself from. If your primary goal is sexual strategy, it is imperative you keep that in mind. Regardless of how lame or sexy your interests are, they should all contribute to your overall frame of reference. Think of \u201cwater cooler talk\u201d. \nEven if videogames aren\u2019t hot, you can still connect with people who play them. \n\nThe key here is to not separate and categorize hobbies and interests, but to pursue them in concert and combine them in interesting ways. For example, if your physical hobby is rock climbing and one of your interests is nature and the outdoors, then every month you go camping with all your gear and climb during the day while sleeping under the stars at night. Doing that is much more interesting than simply going to an indoor climbing gym and walking through the woods behind your house. You create something greater than the sum of its individual parts. These kinds of combinations lead into the third aspect of personality.\n\n**EXPERIENCES**\n\nIt's very easy to fall into a routine of work-gym-eat-sleep-repeat. You sustain yourself \u2013 even stay healthy - but are you really living? Even if you pursue all the hobbies and interests mentioned earlier, you could still spend your entire life in a 10-mile bubble. You need to go out and experience LIFE. 9 times out of 10, if a newbie isn\u2019t making any progress it\u2019s because he\u2019s spending too much time reading and not enough time doing.\n\nClimb a mountain. Tag a watertower. Trip on acid in the desert under a full moon. Party in Ibiza. Get in a fight. Sneak backstage at a concert. Go skydiving. Date a sugar mama. Volunteer at the shelter. Backpack across Asia. Wrestle a large animal. Go to Gay Pride. Learn to backflip. Spend a night on the streets. Take two dates to the same party. Run with the bulls. Hike the Pacific Crest Trail. Go streaking. \n\nNote that some of these activities are HORRENDOUSLY stupid. But that\u2019s the great thing about experiences, they are EXPERIENCE. And even the bad ones make you a stronger, more interesting person. Internalize the good. Learn from the bad. This is part of the reason why girls love bikers, criminals, gangsters, and dealers. They\u2019re doing stuff. They\u2019re exciting. They\u2019re dangerous. I can hear the girls getting wet from here. Even if in the grand scheme of things these guys are in a shitty position, **girls would rather have fun in the dirt than stay clean and bored on the couch**. Girls would rather share an Alpha than own a Beta.\n\nAgain, this is all obvious shit. But if you never venture out of your comfort zone, you will never grow and develop as a human being.  However, it\u2019s not about running around like a headless chicken trying to do as much wacky shit as possible. Yes, in the grand scheme you can travel all around the world collecting notches and accolades, but in the mundane, day-to-day aspect you also need to maintain an active social life. One of the more common questions I see from new subscribers is how to meet girls once they graduate college. *These guys have trouble because they don\u2019t make an effort*. You can be The Most Interesting Man in the World, but you still need to put yourself out there.\n\nMany men enter \"accidental monk mode\". I've been guilty of it myself. You read the literature, you hit the gym, get your career on track, and focus on your hobbies. But since a social life isn't spoon fed to you like it was in high school or college you never go out unless someone drags you. Sometimes it's because your social network is in shambles, sometimes it's because porn and videogames are convenient and available. Before you know it a month goes by and you're in a dry spell.\n\nIf you want a social life you have to WORK for it. Guys complain about never meeting girls, but if they were going to house parties, concerts, doing co-ed athletics, hitting the bars, perfecting their online game, and just generally expanding their social circle, you'd hear a lot less complaining. But that's hard. It's a lot easier to make excuses. **One of the core tenets of TRP is that you as a man are not entitled to anything**. That includes having a good time.\n\nThe next post will discuss developing a sense of humor, becoming more charismatic, and being mindful of the company you keep.\n\n**EDIT: DRUGS ARE BAD KIDS**",

This will probably get buried but if it helps one person understand then it's worth it.\n\nEveryday Christiano Ronaldo goes out and practices soccer\/football. He works out, plays scrimmages, does drills. At the end of the day, he goes home and as of that moment has nothing to show for it. He didn't win any trophies or score any goals that people will see or care about that day at practice. But the practice is essential for his performance in the game. Just because he didn't hoist a trophy at the end of the day doesn't mean the practice was a waste of his time. This is how I see relationships, the only difference is that we just don't know if we're at practice or in the game. If at the end of the day things don't work out that isn't fun, but it also helps us grow and \"get better at the game\" or become better\/more mature people. Our relationships that don't work out are the practice.",

        "body": "Just about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn't too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road.\n\nThis past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel.\n\nAnyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out \"for my safety\" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like \"this country is going to hell in a handbasket.\"\n\nBut you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me.\n\nHe was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck.\n\nNo worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had.\n\nSo, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time **is** money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow...\n\nBut we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is \"Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor\" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English:\n\n\"Today you.... tomorrow me.\"\n\nRolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal.\n\nIn the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through:\n\n\"Today you.... tomorrow me.\"\n\ntl;dr: long rambling story about how the kindness of strangers, particularly folks from south of the border, forced me to be more helpful on the road and in life in general. I am sure it won't be as meaningful to anyone else but it was seriously the highlight of my 2010.\n\n**edit: To the OP, sorry to jack your thread, this has nothing to do with Hitch Hiking. I sort of thought I could just get this off my chest, enjoy the catharsis and watch the story languish at the bottom of the page. Glad people like hearing the tale and I hope it moves you to be more helpful in your day to day. **",

My Junior year after 2-3 years of building up clientele and shifting people over to a network of 3-4 guys who bought quantity (1-2 lbs a week) I was moving close to 10 lbs a week of Mexican dirt weed we called brown frown. I had actually stopped smoking by then and was on the top of my game using codes, counter surveillance, the works. This was the late 90s, early 2000s. I was getting it for $350 a lb., selling $750-$1000 a lb. from some organized criminals from Gary, Indiana. They were actually real gangsters and I was pretty small time compared to them. They rotated cars, had girls running to Texas to pickup dope from I assume cartels, etc. They were black guys in a gang that had a relative in the college who was our connection and probably the whole states connection for college drugs of quantity. \n\nAnyway, some kids from another college had pooled their money together to buy 50 pounds of weed paying 25k. They called the day before stating they had 50k and wanted 100 lbs. So, without fail we delivered two purple Rubbermaid containers of completely nasty molded brown frown marijuana to these two college kids. \n\nWe made them drive around for hours while my other guys tailed them, watched, called, hung-up, basically fucking with them for hours making sure they were legit.  Not talking to police, meeting anyone else, constantly on phones or walkie talkie. When they were about to leave town I drove up on a bicycle (pre-arranged by interstate) as they were parked at a McDonalds eating lunch. I asked to see the money and the driver popped the trunk - I checked it was all there. A buddy pulled up and flipped the containers for cash and I split as they chatted for a sec going through back allies, yards, drains, you name it - scared to death but greedy. My other guys switched cars 2-3 times exchanging and moving money around until the next day where we met and split it up. \n\nWe knew there was no way they knew us, we were so OCD and completely ridiculous about security, names, phones, etc. I had made it my job to study this shit as well as narcotics busts, etc. over the years. \n\nSo, one of my best friends and dealers gets busted a few weeks later by the DEA (were camped out in abandoned church doing surveillance). He gets some time - 1st charge \/ college kid pleads down, they get cash but I didn't know he was dealing cocaine, LSD, Shrooms and the like. He was also stupid throwing drug parties. So long story short he rolls on the guys he had been buying cocaine from (not me thank god). It was the same guys from Gary. They were again an organized gang \/ life-time criminals. \n\nAnyway, he does probation, graduates, get married and has a kid. Five years go by and he's living the life an Engineer doing just fine. He wakes up one day to go take the trash out and catches a bullet to the head in his front yard as the school bus picks up his kid. They never found out who did it, but the number (county) on the license plate was from Gary, Indiana. \n\nTo this day I've never been arrested, don't and haven't used street drugs (since smoking in college) and live a pretty normal life. I pack a gun legally and every time I walk outside my house I feel like it could be my last. \n\n",

        "body": "Two major reasons:\n\nIt gives them an opportunity to weed out applicants for a variety of reasons, both said and unsaid, while citing a polygraph failure as the official reason. When you've got 200 people applying for 3 openings, you want a quick way to whittle that down. Offering a subjective test that's masquerading as an objective test is a really convenient way to do that.\n\n\nSecond reason, and possibly the more important one; not everyone knows it's bullshit. The purpose of a polygraph isn't to detect lies. That isn't possible. It's to get you to admit to things you otherwise would not have, even if it's just admitting that you left something out of your pre-polygraph questionnaire. When a polygraph is administered, the first step is to give you a very long form with a series of yes or no questions. These questions ask all sorts of things like have you ever committed a crime against a person, have you ever stolen property, have you ever committed a traffic offense, have you ever used or sold drugs, etc. If you mark yes to any of these questions, there is usually a blank where you are required to fill out an explanation. Sometime later you are given the actual polygraph test. The examiner has a copy of your questionnaire in front of him. First he will ask you a bunch of preliminary questions that they say are calibrating the equipment. A common one is that they will write the numbers 1 through 5 on a piece of paper and then circle one of them. They will tell you to answer \"no\" to all five of the following questions and then ask you \"is the number one circled, is number two circled, and so on\". \n\nThen they will ask you roughly 10 to 20 questions about your actual past, all of these questions are yes or no. They will ask each question probably 3 or 4 times so while you might get asked fifty to a hundred questions, you might only get asked about 15 unique questions. They just repeat the same ones over and over in different orders, ostensibly measuring your body responses to those questions.\n\nWhile they are are more than willing to use your answers to those questions as a reason to reject you, the real purpose of the test comes after that. This is called the \"post examination interview\". They will make a big show about turning off the equipment, unhooking all the sensors and gear, probably talking to you a little bit about what you had for lunch or what football team you like, all to get you to relax. They will tell you that the test is over and that you are no longer being monitored. Here comes the important part. They then finish by asking you if there's anything you might have left out or any answers you might have wanted to clarify, anything that you may have forgotten to put on your pre-interview questionnaire, etc. They will tell you that it's far better for you to admit to things now since the test results haven't been submitted yet, that you don't want to be found out to be lying later, that it will look good if you would admit to things and that it will show that you're willing to work with them and that you want to be honest if you tell them the whole story about something that you may have not been clear on before or that you may have left out before. If you require a little prodding, the examiner will say something like \"I've got some indicators of deception on questions 3 and 7 regarding your possible past drug use. Are you sure there isn't anything you're not telling me?\" It's a lie, there are no indicators of deception. There is no such thing as an indicator of deception. It's a trick to get you to say something you would not have told them otherwise.\n\nThis is where they get you. The combination of feeling relaxed after the stressful examination, and the desire to appear honest and forthcoming gets a massive amount of people to admit to all sorts of things that they otherwise would not have. \"Oh yeah there was that one time in high school where I guess I sold a couple bags of weed to some of my brother's friends, but I didn't think it was a big deal and it's not like I'm a drug dealer or anything\". \"I wasn't sure if I should put it on the form that I filled out because I didn't get charged or anything, but there was that time seven years ago where I did get arrested for domestic violence, but like I said I didn't get charged and nothing came of it so it's not like I actually committed a crime. I didn't think it was a big deal\". \n\nThank you for your honesty. Rejected.\n\nThe true purpose of the polygraph is to get you to admit to things and basically disqualify yourself. Even if the things you're admitting to by themselves would not have been that big of a deal, the fact that you didn't include them in your questionnaire or you may have given one answer to a background detective previously but gave a different kind of answer to the polygraph examiner, etc. *They're trying to weed out applicants*. It's far easier to have you do it to yourself than it is to pay a background detective to research you, or possibly risk some kind of \"they didn't hire me because I'm black\" lawsuit. If they can show you said A on the form and B to the examiner, you're rejected for lying, it doesn't matter what the smoke and mirrors in the \"lie detector\" say.\n\n\nEDIT: a number of people are responding with comments along the lines of \"this isn't true, the polygraph really does measure things\". Yes, it does. Namely heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductivity(perspiration). The hand-waving comes from where they use this data to imply that you're lying about something. There is no actual evidence those data points have anything to do with lying. A question about whether you've ever had sexual contact with a minor may elicit a response because you did, because you were the *victim* of child abuse, or because the question is just shocking. The data can't tell them which it is, or if you just happen to have a stomach ache. The data they collect does not detect lies. It detects stress (and more to the point, *possible* symptoms of *possible* stress). The underlying theory is that one who is lying is experiencing more stress during the lie than they are when they tell the truth, and that has never been proven to be true.",

I was 11 years old and had gotten into that tinkering phase kids go through and I was fiddling with my brakes, gears, etc. I went on a ride to a super steep hill that was really popular to test my creation.\n\n.\n\nAs I was blasting down the hill the nut that secures the handle bars jostles loose and I loose all semblance of control. I can remember the car coming towards me from the opposite direction but after that I hit the ground.\n\n.\n\nThe car swerved to miss me and went straight into a tree killing the whole family; Mom, Dad and two Sons. I lived in an extremely small town and the aftermath was horrible.\n\n.\n\nLong after the candle light vigils (that I still see in my nightmares) and memorials ended I and my family were bullied, harrassed and generally shunned. Kids can be horrible, but as a child I understood that. But the adults of the town; they were cruel. \n\n.\n\nThey called me MK, Murder Kid. By age 13 I attempted suicide. After a lenghty hospital stay my family had to move to across the State out of the town we went generations back in. \n\n.\n\nIm all grown now and only recently felt safe going back there and to the hill that changed everything, part of my continuing therapy. The worst part about it is at the spot where they died there is a perfectly maintained Cross and flowers bearing their names. \n\n.\n\n\nSomeone still mourns them. Brings flower and clears the weeds away. I was not prepared for that. It ripped open any feelings of closure I had. In my head, it was over for everyone but me. It wasn't\n\n\n.\n\nSo how do I live now? One day at a time. There are good ones and bad one but not a day goes by that I don't think about it. It is like living with a disfigurement, perhaps that biblical Mark of Cain? I feel others can see it in my eyes the same way I can.  \n\n.\n\nEdit: This is the first time outside of my family and my sessions that I have shared this since it happened over 15 years ago. The outpouring has been unbelievable. Just so everyone knows: I am no longer sucidial. The guilt and remorse I carry is my own pain. It is a part of me, part of my life and always will be. \n\n.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart: Thank you\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In theory, I could learn about the big bang, the end of the universe, the entire future of every stock, and most importantly, the genies rules against metawishing. In fact, I should be able to ask it whether there is any process by which I could attain more wishes, and such a vague answer could tell me all I need to know. But for the sake of the question, we will assume that all loopholes are closed.\n\nWish #2 \"I wish that I have full control of my body in accordance with my intent, such that if I desire immortality, my biological body and DNA would adjust with no ill effects or drawbacks to such a state instantly and insuch a way that nothing bad could happen as a result of the wish but with no limitations on the extent, duration, or power of the ability.\"\n\nThis wish is also important, because as with the previous one, if worded correctly, it is very powerful. If I want to become biologically immortal, then I become biologically immortal, with no ill effects and in complete accordance with what I want to happen, so that I don't regress into youth. Similarly, I could become stronger, smarter, and faster merely by thinking about it.\n\nFor my third wish, I am going to wimp out and just ask the tablet from the first wish what I should wish for that would provide the most benefit to me. Really, the strategy is in asking for versatile gifts. The first one is the best, because it can do mind reading, precognition, objective facts, infinite knowledge, the most accurate Wikipedia version ever, infinite money, the best advice, key to political success, etc. Really, something like that would be what I would wish for. And the genie thinks wishing for more wishes is overpowered. I would show him overpowered.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold. I find it comforting that I might have a good grounding if I ever decide to change my major from CompSci to Law. Admittedly, I plan to go into Cyber security, and that field has more to do with loopholes and logic mistakes than other computing areas IMO.",

This document is perhaps a good reflection of attitude problems that our society (and particularly males ) harbors deep in them.)**\n\n**Edit 1: *I did not write this.* Somehow was in my archival files from late early 2000s. This is at least 15 years old, you can see almost no reference to any social media types. Posted it here for wider audience**\n\nARRANGED MARRIAGE: THE SEARCH FOR BEAUTY\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n( A collection of tips to find a beautiful wife)\n\nIf you are a typical, single, Indian man who lives in the USA, the\ntime will come when it will dawn on you that the only chance you have\nto indulge in wedded bliss lies in the hallowed institution of the\n\"Arranged Marriage\". You probably left India when you were twenty-one,\nhaving squandered your adolescence striving to get here. At this\npoint, you are twenty-five or older, and have been out of touch with\nthe general Indian female population for more than a decade. All the\nwomen you know back home are married. This manual is written for those\nof you who harbor hopes of acquiring a beautiful arranged bride.\nIf you belong to the rarified set of intellectuals to whom the\nexternal female form holds no charms, and those who evaluate others\naccording to the quality of their inner selves, this manual is not for\nyou. Before you stop reading, please accept my heartiest\ncongratulations on your self control and ideological correctness. I\nam not worthy of even addressing you (kneel! kneel!).\nNo, this manual is for the rest of you, mere mortals, who still have\nenough red blood in their veins so that you can admit, even to\nyourselves, that you rather like the idea of having a beautiful wife.\nOf course, before I even go about describing how to acquire beauty, it\nis necessary to define it. And this is where I expect the most\ndisagreement. There will be those among you who proclaim, \"But beauty\nis in the eye of the beholder!\" And you would be partly right.\n\nIf you are a man who equates beauty to facial attractiveness, there is\nnot much that this manual can do for you. You are a very fortunate\nman, for Indian women have the most beautiful faces of any race in the\nworld. You have a very large pool to choose from, and you do not need\nmuch help in choosing, because you can look at each prospective\nbride's face and decide whether she is beautiful or not.\n\nNo, this is written for those who would like their wife to have a good\nfigure too. For you, the job is harder. Typically, Indian women do not\nget much physical exercise, and consequently, if they are not scrawny,\ntend to be on the overweight side. Why do you think sarees are so\npopular in India? Because they can hide all the embarrassing bulk!\nSome men think that Indian women do not have shapely legs by reasons\nof genetics. I say to them, check out the figures of the IA (ABCD to\nyou politically incorrect guys) women. They are on par with anything\nI have seen on any other race. This is because IA women work out and\ntake care to keep themselves in shape. You cannot go covering yourself\nup around here, not if you want to get dates.\n\nIf you are one of those academic types who have not given much thought\nto the matter, or merely one of those blighters who like to ask\nintelligent questions to which you already know the answers, and ask\nme, \"But why does one NEED a beautiful wife?\" I would reply that\nbeauty is a double edged sword. It has its advantages and\ndisadvantages, some of which I summarize below.\n\nAdvantages of having a beautiful wife.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\na) A beautiful girl is much easier to adjust to than an\nunattractive one. You will be much more tolerant of her faults during\nthe initial \"adjustment\" phase of marriage, simply because you will\nnot have the heart to get irritated with someone so lovely. She will\nbe much easier to forgive after a fight.\n\nb) If you are the typical desi engineer, you will not be exactly\nAdonis Reborn. If your wife is homely too, your child will probably\nlook like the Swamp Thing, or the Blob. If you love your unborn\nchildren, you owe it to them to give them a beautiful mother.\n\nc) A beautiful wife enhances your social stature. People will\nlook at you and think, \"How the ^&*% did that !@## land such a\ngorgeous babe? He must have something that is not visible on the\noutside!\" You will get invited to more parties, especially by men who\nwant to spend the evening drooling at her. Conversely, if your wife is\nhomely, you will be rather embarrassed to take her to gatherings of\nyour friends, especially if they are all married to knockouts.\n\nd) And most importantly, sex will be much better if your wife is\ngood-looking. Otherwise, after a couple of years when the pent-up\nhorniness of the past 25+ years has worn off, you probably will not be\neven able to get it up, unless you resort to ungentlemanly and\nundignified tactics, like fantasising about Sridevi when you are in\nbed.\n\nDisadvantages of having a beautiful wife.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\na) If you are one of those for whom innocence, virtue, and chastity\nare important, beautiful women are not for you. My empirical research\nshows that, while beauty (or the lack of it) in a woman is in no way\nindicative of her intelligence, beautiful women are invariably very\nstreet-smart. They KNOW that they are good looking, and have got used\nto people bending over backwards to accommodate them. This dawns on\nthem very early on in life, when they observe that teachers are much\nnicer to them than to their less-attractive friends, when almost all\nthe men they encounter behave like brainless, testeterone-driven apes\nin their presense, when they observe that they get things done twice\nas quickly in a government office.\n\nAs a teenager in college, a beautiful woman would have had lots of men\nvying with each other for her friendship and affections. She would\nhave to be more than human not to have enjoyed the attention. She\nwould have played the men one against the other, as women have done\nsince time immemorial. She might have dated, and even had affairs. In\nthe process, she would get to know men all too well, and would realize\nthat they are but putty in the hands of a good-looking woman.\n\nb) A good-looking woman is more than a match for the average desi\nengineer. She will twist you around her little finger and make you\njump through hoops. Things will get done her way nearly all the time.\nOf course, it will be fun to jump through hoops for someone as lovely\nas she is. A homely woman, on the other hand, will usually be so\ngrateful to you for marrying her that she will treat you like a king.\n\nc) As I mentioned before, a beautiful woman is unlikely to be\nparticularly virtuous or righteous. But that is okay, since too much\nvirtue often goes hand-in-hand with rather undesirable traits. A\nvirtuous woman may also be ugly, weird, boring, hyper-religious or\nfrigid.\n\nd) A beautiful woman is more likely to \"stray\" after marriage\ntoo. This is the USA, and the fact that a woman is married does not\nmake her off-limits to adventurers or would-be Casanovas. The more\nlovely a woman is, the more likely is she to be propositioned by her\nmale colleagues or friends. Ergo, she is subject to much more\ntemptation than her homely counterparts. Think about this... how\nwould it be if women kept asking you, a man, to make love to them? How\nmany times would you refuse?\n\nHow to go about selecting a beautiful wife.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFirst of all, there is the matter of mentioning the fact to your\nparents. If your parents are anything like mine, they will freak out\nwhen they hear that their dear devoted son is actually interested in\nearthy things like beauty (and, by extrapolation, sex). It is not\nconsidered good form to say that beauty is important to you in Indian\ncircles.\n\nHere is a very important tip... do not leave bride-hunting to your\nparents! Beauty is going to be the last of their priorities, coming\nafter caste, horoscopes, family background, perceived virtue of the\ngirl etc. Make it very clear to them that beauty is high on your list\nof priorities. State in no uncertain terms that you will not marry\nanyone who does not measure up to your standards. That will prevent\nthem from goofing off during bride-hunting, shirking their\nresponsibilities and palming off some family-friend's daughter on you.\n\nAnother unpalatable fact is that your mother will not want you to\nmarry someone too beautiful. This often comes as a surprise to most\nsons, but the reason is simple. Mothers know that, sooner or later,\nthere will be a tussle between her and her daughter-in-law over her\nson's affections and loyalties. Since women are extremely conscious\nof their looks and tend to rate themselves accordingly, a beautiful\nwoman has a psychological advantage over a less attractive one in an\nargument. Also, your mother knows that a beautiful wife will tilt the\nscales against her as far as you are concerned, since such a wife will\nprobably have you dangling by the balls, if you pardon the expression.\nSo, left to herself, your mother will limit her search to women who\nare less attractive than she perceives herself to be.\n\nBefore you start on your bride-hunting, you should convince yourself\nthat you deserve a beautiful wife. Do not ever think, \"But I am not so\ngood-looking anyway, what right have I to demand a lovely girl?\"\nSince Man started walking the earth, it has been the man's wealth that\nhas been traded off for the woman's beauty. Rest assured that your\nlooks will be the last thing on a girl's mind when she rates you as a\nprospective husband. (I am limiting myself to arranged marriages\nhere). She will be weighing your earning potential, green-card\npotential etc. Even in this land of feminism, \"Cosmopolitan\" has\narticles on \"How to hook a rich husband\" and \"The ten best places to\nmeet successful men\".\n\nYou have worked hard, and wasted ten of the most wonderful years of\nyour life getting where you are. You deserve to get something out of\nit. Do not squander your bargaining position. In other words, do not\nbe ashamed to make your preference for beauty known.\n\nHow to check whether she is beautiful.\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFirst of all, never consent to marry a girl whom you have seen only in\n\nphotographs. PHOTOGRAPHS LIE!!!! Photography is an art that can make\nHKL Bhagat look like Zeenat Aman. All too often, photographs sent to\nprospective suitors contain only the face. Also, they usually have\nbeen so air-brushed and sanitized, all the pimples and other\nirregularities removed, that the end product has little in common with\nthe original. Also, it is a certain fact that no woman will consent to\nsend you photograph that presents herself in an unflattering light.\n\nThese days, in the urban areas of India, it is often the practice to\ntake an album-full of pictures of a girl when she gets to marriageable\nage. These pictures show the girl in various outfits, eastern and\nwestern. The album is then sent to prospective grooms-in-the-states.\nDuring my last visit to India, I learned from an authoritative source\nthat many of these pictures are blatant forgeries, involving splicing\nthe girl's head on to the figure of some other girl, sometimes\nprofessional models. In one case, pictures of a girl's good-looking\nsister were went out instead. Bottom line: do not make a decision\nbased merely on photographs!\n\nDarshan.\n^^^^^^^\n\nOnce you see the girl directly, you can easily check whether her face\nmeasures up. The figure is a different matter altogether. Women have\nconducted more research into packaging themselves than have been\nconducted on the entire US space effort. You should realize that,\nwhile you were struggling in your engineering program in undergraduate\non grad school, women were learning the techniques of camouflage. She\nKNOWS that it is her looks that count. By packaging herself so that\nshe seems attractive to a non-resident Indian for about 10 minutes,\nshe can earn all that it took the NRI 10 years of hard work to\nrealize. Women are extremely honest with their friends about their\npositive and negative points. They are intensely aware of their flaws,\nand work systematically towards concealing them.\n\nSo, if she seems to have a liking for loose, flowing sarees or\nsalwar-kameez, keep your mind open to the possibility that she may be\noverweight. That fold of her saree draped oh-so-elegantly across her\nmidriff might be concealing a paunch. It it is wound demurely around\nher back, she probably has spare tires. Does she walk slowly and\nsedately, like an old Spanish galleon making its way across the seas?\nShe is probably holding her paunch in.\n\nSo what do you do if she always appears in such clothes? You cannot\nvery well demand that she change clothes... that would be outrageously\nbad form. AND SHE KNOWS THAT! One way to approach such a problem is\nthe following. Tell her that she cannot wear a saree in the states,\nthat it would be embarrassing for you. Tell her that if she is not\nwilling to wear jeans, shorts and pants on a regular basis, you are\nprobably not a good choice for her. Subtly hint that you would like to\nsee her in western clothes. If she refuses flat-out, my friend, you\ncan be sure that she is hiding something. If she has a good figure,\nshe will make damned sure that you see it.\n\nA large percentage of women in India have huge hips and very heavy\nthighs. This is mainly due to lack of exercise. In a saree or\nchuridar, it is impossible to check for these, which is why they are\nso popular. If a woman states that she does not wear pants, warning\nbells should ring in her mind. One way to check for obesity under a\nsaree or salwar is to note the relative positions of her bosom and\nmidriff. For a woman with a good figure, the bosom should be at a\nconsiderably higher level. If she dresses so that the bosom does not\nstand out, it is almost surely because she has a paunch that comes to\nthe same level. Or she may be droopy, saggy or totally flat.\n\nLet me reiterate, if a girl has something to show, she will make\ndamned sure that you will see it.\n\nOne way to see how your prospective bride looks when she is not\ndressed up is to ask to see her family albums. NOT the ones that they\nkeep out ostentatiously but the ones that they keep tucked away at the\ncorner of the shelf. A lot of overweight women go through crash diets\nduring the wedding season, starving themselves or going to\nprofessional \"fat-farms\" to lose dozens of pounds, to get into\npresentable shape for the darshan. I know of one woman who lost 60\npounds in 8 months preparing for the wedding. She quickly gained it\nall back after the marriage. Pictures of the woman taken 2 or 3 years\nago should tell you whether she is inclined to obesity.\n\nIf, on the other hand, she is a thin woman who has padded herself up\nto look good on darshan day, there is no way on earth that you can\ntell. The best way to check for this sort of stuff is to enlist the\nhelp of a sympathetic, liberated, female, friend, sister or other\nrelative. She can easily see through the disguise and give you\nunbiased estimates of the interior. So, if you have a sister, you had\nbetter start being nice to her.\n\nHAPPY HUNTING! ... UNITING!\n",

        "body": "When I was 18, I enrolled in the military in my home country.  During that time, I was allocated to a 1-month long sharpshooter course. It was winter and we got our training close to -30 degrees Celsius. \n\nThe story itself is quite long and very interesting and in retrospect it was very enlightening. I got a lot of life lessons and improved my mental toughness. To read it in closer detail, then check out [this blog post](http:\/\/siimland.com\/]. I've also made [a video about it.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I4kl7d0_ie0) \nCheck out the [video on my YouTube channel.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I4kl7d0_ie0) \n\n\n**Here are a few key points to take away from this experience which are most important.**\n\n\n\n * **Get comfortable being uncomfortable.** Whether lying in the dirt, monitoring the landscape while being buried in snow or doing anything that we don\u2019t want to \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. This will determine the way we handle anything that life throws at us. This way we\u2019re preparing ourselves for situations that are not perfect and won\u2019t be perished by the difficulties. \n\n * **Adversity is to be expected and welcomed.** Challenges are inevitable part of life. Moreover, they make us who we are. There is a difference in yielding to obstacles and overcoming them. The former implies to coping while the latter is thriving and empowering. \n\n * **It is easier to do it the hard way.** As humans we always want to take the path of least resistance. However, this is conditions us in a negative way. Without adversity we would get too soft. In the long run having it tough will make us more able to overcome any obstacle.\n\n * **Always be prepared.** Expect for the worst case scenario to happen and already come up with solutions to deal with it beforehand. Never get out of shape or unable to train. Never think that you've made it with financial affluence, fitness, your mindset or relationships. You have to maintain them constantly as to not take them for granted. Always keep yourself ready both physically and mentally. \n\n * **Always over-deliver.** Later in my service, our company leader would give us many assignments because he knew we would always get it over with. He would usually say: \"Put your eyes on it.\" But we would always over-deliver and exceed his expectations. At one time, we were assigned to go out on a simple routinely patrol but ended up with imprisoning an entire enemy squad. At others, we lurked in between swamps behind the enemy lines, discovered their armoured vehicles and called mortar rounds on them. This is crucial here because any fool can endure comfort and simply grind through. It\u2019s more important to be able to perform under those same conditions.\n\n * **We\u2019re a lot more durable than we give ourselves credit for.** A lot of the time it is our mind that gets in our own way. This applies to physical and mental activities \u2013 our maximum is always higher than we think. If we are forced to suffer freezing weather or pain with no way out then the only thing we can do is to simply grind our teeth, adapt and endure.\n \n * **Putting in more effort will yield extraordinary results.** After coming to the realization that we\u2019re powerful beyond measure exceeding ourselves becomes easy. It\u2019s important to always give our best. Pushing our boundaries further will make us grow and make us better. Never have I regretted taking the extra step or rep further despite the difficulty. It's the actions we didn't take we'll regret the most.\n\n * **Pain as well as comfort are temporary.** Whether we\u2019re experiencing physical hardship or cozyness it doesn\u2019t matter. The workout will reach its end, the weather will get warmer, the feeling of safety and dryness will soon be replaced by freezing conditions \u2013 everything will be replaced by its polar opposite one way or the other. By realizing this we will be able to endure for longer as well as appreciate the comfort we\u2019re currently in more.\n\n * **The person beyond our comfort zone is awesome.** Continuing on the previous bullet point. If we put in just a little bit of effort and exceed our limitations then we begin to see ourselves differently. We are more capable and confident in our own abilities. Success and self-love becomes a habit. \n\n * **We're all incredibly lucky.** If you're reading this, then you probably have no idea how fortunate you really are. My sniper course lasted for a month, yet it felt like an eternity. It wasn't even a real conflict or warzone. It was just training. After graduating, I attained a new perspective on life - to not take anything for granted and to protect my family from the challenges I had to go through. I felt more obliged to start giving back more an to make the world a better place, so that there would be no necessity for warfare.\n\n * **Most importantly, I understood that we should all be striving towards making the world a safer and better place for everyone.** Being a soldier isn't the best way of bringing peace. Partly, there I found some purpose of starting my work of empowering myself and others. At least it got amplified even more.\n\nAfter going through that 1 month of hardship I improved the quality of the rest of my life. It increased my mental toughness to a limit where I felt invincible and independent of external forces. My mind became a citadel and I truly believe that anything else can hardly be called challenging in comparison to what I went through at sniper school.\n\nHopefully this will be somewhat motivating and give you a clue about some of the revelations I've had. \n\nCheck out the [video on my YouTube channel.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=I4kl7d0_ie0) \n\nThanks!\nStay Empowered!\n",

And I fully expect to receive down votes for simply having admitted that I am a Lewis fan, but here goes. \n\nRosberg has been a gentleman of the sport for as long as I can remember (and I'm talking motorsport in general not just since his arrival in F1 in 2006). In fact he has been one of the stand out 'nice-guys' amongst all the egos, arrogance and cash flashing. He has been quiet, reserved and kind in almost every situation he has been in (obvious adrenaline fuelled anger excluded!). He has displayed an extraordinary speed, even compared to Hamilton who has had an edge in pure pace over every team mate he has ever had. \n\nNico pretty much always had something positive to say, he never fully showed his emotion; and of course, because of the cut throat nature of F1 people saw this as weakness. My self included. But this year, Nico beat Lewis (it's still sinking in). No matter what people say, you DO NOT luck into a world championship. Our sport has showed us that you need skill and determination to succeed, you need a ferocious drive to win. A Commitment that ordinary people cannot even dream of, a strength so great that it exceeds the strength of the body and becomes a strength of the mind and spirit. It seems to me that in our great sport it is impossible to have an undeserving champion. \nNico pushed all year, harder than anyone else in the field. He was totally, constantly in full attack mode. He bought us some great racing, whether it was fighting through the pack in Malaysia and Austria or racing Lewis and sometimes the Red Bulls up front. Nico put himself in that position through shear brute force. Every time. Sure Lewis has had problems, but who was there to put it on pole or collect maximum points when he did? Nico was. He has been relentless. He has showed a deft touch behind the wheel that I and many others speculated he may not have, and proved that he has a calm head and pure talent during a race. He simply refused to let Lewis walk off with the title again. It was simply not within him to lose to Lewis.\n   For these reasons he is as much a champion as any other driver through the history of the sport. It was beat \"Lewis, or nothing\". That's one of the things I respect so much about Lewis, so I would be a fool not recognise it in another driver.\nAnd I know people will say, and already have said things like \"he only won because Lewis failed\" and \"he's scared he won't beat Lewis in a fair fight so he's quitting\". It is quite obvious to me now how untrue these and other such statements are. His retirement for me shows pure strength of character. He is content in his ability, and has achieved his life's goal. How many of us can say we have done that? And instead of pushing for more success, more riches or more fame, The Gentleman of F1 will retire and build on his family life. And I can hazard a guess that it will be a considerably richer life than a lot of people can claim too.\n\nSorry for the essay, it just recently dawned on me how big of an impact Nico has had on my love of the sport and I for one will be sorry to see him go. Also I'm in France with a bunch of people who don't care about F1 so I need to express myself!\nI hope to hear what you guys think, even if you think I'm totally wrong! And of course, feel free to down vote me for my Hamilton Fandom. \nThanks guys.     ",
