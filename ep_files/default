Most people avoid them. I don’t, though, and here are 10 reasons why:\u003C\/u\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E1. Late night flights are often cheaper.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EFor my recent flight from Kolkata to Bangalore, a ticket that cost more than Rs. 18000 for a mid-day flight cost just Rs. 12000 for a late night flight.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E2. Late night flights offer faster check in.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAirports tend to be less busy late at night; from curb to check-in, your jaunt to the gate is likely to be smoother and quicker than it would be during the day.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E3. Late night flights often fly well below capacity.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMid-day flights are often full. Late night flights aren’t… which means the one seat you paid for can often turn into three seats for stretching out and taking a nap. Fewer passengers also means you’re more likely to snag the increasingly coveted airline blanket.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cb\u003E4. Late night flights are less rowdy.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EParents with crying kids. Businesspeople knocking back a few drinks. The overexcited tourist who just can’t wait to get to Goa and gamble away her retirement. They’re all absent from late night flights.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E5. Late night flights are more luggage friendly.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EFewer passengers = more overhead bin space and less luggage in cargo. Less luggage in cargo = faster baggage claim.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E6. Late night flights let you get in a full day’s work.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EMid-day flights always leave me feeling as if I’ve lost a whole day of work, leaving me cranky. A late night flight, however, lets me get in at least a half-day’s work, and I can squeeze in a full day’s work if I’m not procrastinating.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E7. Late night flights let you avoid rush hour traffic.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIf you've ever travelled to Bangalore airport in evening traffic, you would know what I am talking about. Sometimes, the headache of air travel has nothing to do with air at all, but with on the ground traffic. As an example, Kolkata to Bangalore takes 2 hours while Bangalore Airport to my house in Bangalore takes 2.5 hours. You can avoid morning and afternoon rush hours by taking the late night flight.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E8. Late night flights tend to be on time.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWith less air and runway traffic compared to morning and afternoon flights, late night flights tend to arrive and depart on time.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E9. Late night flights allow you to manage your appetite.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003ELike work, eating habits always seem to get thrown off by morning or mid-day flights. With a late night flight, though, it’s possible to eat breakfast and lunch, and to pack a light snack for the plane.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E10. Late night flights leave you less prone to losing stuff.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EWith fewer people, CISF screeners, gate agents, and flight attendants are all more likely to have more time to devote to you… which means they’re more likely to see and return the laptop you left behind at the x-ray machine or the camera you forgot in the overhead bin.\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/1615633968405582551\/posts\/default\/2850982244518912083"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/1615633968405582551\/posts\/default\/2850982244518912083"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/evolvingperceptions1.blogspot.com\/2016\/08\/why-i-love-red-eye-flights.html","title":"Why I love red-eye flights"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Misbah Ahmed"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/103211590193139603627"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"32","height":"32","src":"\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/-sQV7pC4CN8o\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAEj8\/IodjzW1H8ZE\/s512-c\/photo.jpg"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1615633968405582551.post-9058241787371175846"},"published":{"$t":"2016-08-31T05:20:00.001-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2016-09-03T08:05:48.566-07:00"},"title":{"type":"text","$t":"What does education mean?"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cdiv dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"\u003EI few days ago, I was out with my sister and her friends for a lunch at \u003Ca href=\"https:\/\/www.zomato.com\/bangalore\/red-fork-indiranagar\"\u003ERed Fork, Indiranagar\u003C\/a\u003E.

The very first thing we see Joker do is rob a mafia controlled bank, eliminating the entire team of expert bank robbers who helped him pull it off. Of course, the robbery wasn't about the money, it was about luring Lau out of hiding, preferably with all the major crime families' collective money.\u0026nbsp;This works beautifully, and as Joker predicts, Batman goes to Hong Kong to \"Extradite\" Lau. Now Lau is in a safe place which Joker can, amazingly, access with ease. This of course is all just the plot of the film, but Joker is playing it amazingly, murdering key criminals and corrupt officials that could help insulate those at the top. Dent actually argues FOR insulating the men on the top in the interest of cleaning the streets of lower-level goons, but Joker knows that won't work in the long-term.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAt this point we honestly just have 3 men battling for Gotham's \"soul\" (as Joker puts it), but Dent and Wayne are simply playing into Joker's greater plan. This even extends to Joker's threats to destroy a hospital. With Batman and Gordon's help, Joker helps them root out corrupt police officials. Dent even kills some of those officials later in the film.\u0026nbsp;Gordon's promotion, too, did a major service to Gotham. I think a lot of people take the Joker's clapping during Gordon's promotion scene to be sarcastic, but I actually think that Joker believed in Gordon, one of the few officers on the force who was truly incorruptible.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E So now Joker has a pretty clear path to getting rid of the Organized Crime problem and the corrupt officials problem, but the Vigilante problem remains. As we saw at the beginning of the film, Batman was inspiring other vigilantes, and a society cannot stand when each man takes his own justice. This symbol of fear and unbridled vengeance, as Joker sees it, needs to be stopped, but not Killed. If he were killed, he would just be a martyr, and his symbol would live on. Of course, since Dent was a far better symbol for the city, he would make a far better martyr. I don't know if Joker actually intended for Harvey to be so physically scarred by the explosion from which Batman saved him, but I am certain that he wanted Harvey to feel the full pain of Rachel's death, which is why he purposely tells Batman to go to the wrong address. He knows what Rachel's death would do to Harvey psychologically, and that Batman would eventually have no choice but to kill Harvey. This breaks Batman psychologically, and also makes him a villain, a true villain, the kind that abandons his own principles. Batman now has no choice but to disappear, leaving his memory to fade into something of urban legend by the time of TDKR.\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E When we pick up in the next film we see a defeated Bruce Wayne who had retired 8 years prior. The city was safe and peaceful (until Bane shows up), and doesn't need constant vigilante justice to keep it safe. Joker shows Batman the error of his ways, but does so in a totally devastating way.\u0026nbsp;Even the display with the two boats at the film's climax only served to prove to the people of Gotham that they wouldn't turn on each other. He proved that there was good even in the most supposedly despicable of Gotham's inmates.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E In the end Gotham is actually clean. It wasn't because of Harvey, who died too soon to do any good, except as a martyr, and it wasn't because of Batman who was ostracized and treated like the criminal such a vigilante truly is for 8 years. Gotham was safe because the Joker had cleaned up the streets. He eliminated the corrupt police, he destroyed organized crime financially, he uplifted Gotham's spirit, and he even got rid of the flying pest that had been corrupting Gotham ever since he declared himself it's protector.\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/1615633968405582551\/posts\/default\/2588859942882710420"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/1615633968405582551\/posts\/default\/2588859942882710420"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/evolvingperceptions1.blogspot.com\/2016\/07\/the-hero-of-gotham.html","title":"The Hero of Gotham"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Misbah Ahmed"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/103211590193139603627"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"32","height":"32","src":"\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/-sQV7pC4CN8o\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAEj8\/IodjzW1H8ZE\/s512-c\/photo.jpg"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1615633968405582551.post-1491005246435056546"},"published":{"$t":"2016-07-14T10:52:00.000-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2016-09-03T08:09:43.201-07:00"},"title":{"type":"text","$t":"What Z category protection feels like?"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cdiv dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"\u003EContrary to what most people may think, a Z+ cover is a big problem for those who do not want it for the sake of showing-off . Security like that limits time and movement. It also requires immaculate planning by the team. Some people said that Z+ has 3 vehicles and 36 people in the convoy. The reality is that local police are usually present to assist the convoy and hence this brings up the total no of vehicles to 5 or 6. \u003Cbr \/\u003E \u003Cb\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E Time \u0026amp; Protocol Issues\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EUnder normal circumstances, if the protectee has to visit someone, he informs the PSO (Personal Security Officer) regarding the visit. The PSO is usually the person closest to the protectee and rides shotgun in his car. He asks for a 30 min. period for reconnaissance \u0026amp; planning and is usually granted that time. One primary route and 2 alternates ones are prepared, to be used in case of emergency. The PSO calls up local authorities (civilian police) in that area and asks them for ROPs (Road Opening Party). These advance teams sweep the routes beforehand and clear traffic congestions, road blocks etc. A patrolman is placed at each intersection so as to stop the traffic when the convoy arrives. He is on the same frequency as the pilot vehicle leading the convoy. Only when this is completed, does the VIP leave his house. This protocol is usually adhered to in most situations, broken only in the extreme case of an emergency. The pilot and the tail vehicle usually belong to the local police and provide tactical support within their jurisdiction. They are changed whenever their jurisdiction changes. This change, if you ever see it happening, is executed with clockwork precision. The convoy moves along normally. The new pilot comes alongside the convoy, speeds up, changes lanes \u0026amp; takes lead. The old pilot takes a left lane \u0026amp; exits the road. The new tail moves alongside the older one in a parallel lane. As soon as a median is encountered, the old tail takes a U-Turn and the new tail joins in. This maneuver is executed at more than 50 kph usually.\u0026nbsp;You might have seen big red flags on the lead and tail vehicle. These flags indicate the start \u0026amp; end of the convoy. Under no circumstances can any other vehicle enter between these two cars. If you find yourself behind such a convoy, follow them at a distance \u0026amp; overtake only if you can pass them all at once. Do not abort the maneuver between 2 of such vehicles.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E Privacy Concerns\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIf you need to go somewhere alone without cover, it's almost impossible. For example, going for a date becomes a pain. I know of a guy who gave some excuse about visiting his friend, while he was going out with his girlfriend. His father did not allow him out without security but he was adamant that day. So they (his father \u0026amp; PSO) agreed. He left in a joyful mood, having no one to report about his date. But as soon as his car left the building, a black Skoda silently followed him at a distance, its occupants being 3 armed guards and a skilled driver. Yes, this is the kind of privacy issues Z+ cover brings with it. Unless you belong to the Federalnaya Sluzhba Kontrrazvedki, you won't spot or lose the tail.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cb\u003EIn-House Protection\u003C\/b\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn-house protection is usually accompanied by layers of additional security elements depending on the threat perception. This is paid for and maintained personally. A car at the front gate is in full view of a camera atop the wall. The visitor will usually press a button on the intercom \u0026amp; will talk to a guard in a cabin just within the gate, who will check with the security office inside the building. If the visit is planned, the guard will then emerge via a side gate to check identification papers. If these are in order, he will retire to his cabin and press a button. The gates will open and the car will go forward to the gravel forecourt where more guards will be waiting. Since this treatment is meted out to each \u0026amp; everyone, it has some privacy concerns. I know at least two people who were thoroughly offended when searched by the guards. I state some common security measures that are usually used in VVIP houses. Please keep in mind that this varies from person to person. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cul style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESome houses have dogs behind chain-link fences. There are two teams, and each responds only to one dog handler. The handlers work alternate nights. After dark (usually 2200 hrs), gates in the fencing are opened and the dogs have the run of the whole estate. Thereafter the guard stays inside his cabin, and in the event of a late visitor he contacts the handler to call off the dogs. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAll the locks are electromagnetic, and access is strictly monitored. Meaning that, if a specific door is opened via a card, the security guard monitoring the cameras checks manually if the person is authorized to open it. Eg. the study is usually closed to everybody except the immediate family members. No cleaners, no maid, no nothing.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESome houses have a electronically controlled spikes mounted after the main gate \u0026amp; before the house entrance. Once a vehicle enters the roller gates, the gates close automatically. Here the guards will check the vehicle for threats etc. When they are convinced, the spikes strip will be withdrawn. Then \u0026amp; only then can the vehicle proceed forward.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cb\u003EThe men \u0026amp; the equipment\u003C\/b\u003EThe NSG guards use the Heckler \u0026amp; Koch MP5 Sub-machine gun. It can empty its 30 round magazine in a couple of seconds, but the firing is limited to two shot bursts, with one repeat. Anyone stopping those four rounds will start feeling unwell very fast. Such economy also allows for taking the perpetrators into custody (after treatment) for interrogation. Some specific teams(or team members) use the SG 550\/551 assault rifle. This horror fires 650 rounds per minute and each round is a 5.56-mm slug, a single one of which will pull a human body apart. So intense is the fire of this gun that if used in a closed room for 3 seconds nothing much bigger than a dormouse will be left alive. And the mouse will die of shock. A Glock 17 handgun is used as a backup weapon and is usually holstered on the hip. Cars used are generally NIJ level III or IV. If the government doesn't have such a car available, the protectee's private car is often converted to a armoured one.\u003Cul style=\"line-height: 21px; margin: 0px 2em 1em 0px; padding: 0px;\"\u003E\u003C\/ul\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/1615633968405582551\/posts\/default\/1491005246435056546"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/1615633968405582551\/posts\/default\/1491005246435056546"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/evolvingperceptions1.blogspot.com\/2016\/07\/what-z-category-protection-feels-like.html","title":"What Z category protection feels like?"}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Misbah Ahmed"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/103211590193139603627"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"32","height":"32","src":"\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/-sQV7pC4CN8o\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAEj8\/IodjzW1H8ZE\/s512-c\/photo.jpg"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1615633968405582551.post-8974229427859149160"},"published":{"$t":"2016-06-26T11:21:00.000-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2016-09-03T08:10:06.706-07:00"},"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Brexit \u0026 the pied piper"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cdiv dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"\u003EThe UK leaves the EU, Australia has had five prime ministers in five years and the poor yanks look as though we'll have to choose between two options both of which have more disapproval than approval.

Agricultural workers are almost entirely informal.

Though no one knows the exact reasons for sure, it seems likely that travelling on the left of the road became the obvious choice in ancient times. Indeed Roman coins from 50 AD have been found which depict horsemen passing on each other’s right. Horse travel in often violent times is the key to why driving on the left became popular. A horse rider would carry their sword in a scabbard on their left hand side , which they would draw, and use with their right hand. It therefore made sense for the right arm, when wielding the sword to be nearer a potential opponent and further away when in the scabbard. That made travelling on the left the safest and most obvious method.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EAlso, right handed people generally mount a horse from the animals left, and it would be hard to do otherwise if wearing a sword on the left. Obviously, it’s safer to mount and dismount at the side of the road rather than in the centre, so if a rider mounts on the left it would make sense for the horse to then be ridden on the left.\u003Cbr \/\u003E​\u003Cbr \/\u003EA change to the left hand driving trend occurred in the late 1700s. In the USA large wagons pulled by several horses began to be used to transport products. These wagons had no driver’s seat; instead the driver sat on the left rear horse, (called postilion riding) so he could keep his right whip arm free to lash the team. Since he was sitting on the left, the driver has the best view of the distance between his vehicle and oncoming traffic by keeping to the right. Also, the French Revolution of 1789 helped the shift to right-hand travel in Europe. Before the revolution it was customary for the aristocracy to travel on the left of the road and force slower moving peasant traffic over to the right. After the storming of the Bastille, aristocrats adopted a lower profile when travelling and joined the peasants on the right.Later , As Napoleon conquered nations he would force them to adopt driving on the right which spread the right hand trend through Europe .\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EIn spite of the shift to driving on the right, Britain stuck with the left hand driving rule and countries which were part of the British Empire were made to follow suit. This is why India, Australasia and the former British colonies in Africa continue to drive on the left. One exception is Egypt, as that country was conquered by Napoleon before becoming a British dependency. Other colonies also adopted the driving style of their mother country.\u003C\/div\u003E"},"link":[{"rel":"edit","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/1615633968405582551\/posts\/default\/6163971173245894363"},{"rel":"self","type":"application/atom+xml","href":"http:\/\/www.blogger.com\/feeds\/1615633968405582551\/posts\/default\/6163971173245894363"},{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http:\/\/evolvingperceptions1.blogspot.com\/2015\/09\/logic-behind-india-driving-on-left-hand.html","title":"Logic behind India driving on the left hand side of the road."}],"author":[{"name":{"$t":"Misbah Ahmed"},"uri":{"$t":"https:\/\/plus.google.com\/103211590193139603627"},"email":{"$t":"noreply@blogger.com"},"gd$image":{"rel":"http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail","width":"32","height":"32","src":"\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/-sQV7pC4CN8o\/AAAAAAAAAAI\/AAAAAAAAEj8\/IodjzW1H8ZE\/s512-c\/photo.jpg"}}]},{"id":{"$t":"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1615633968405582551.post-8891486928228785120"},"published":{"$t":"2015-09-22T10:54:00.000-07:00"},"updated":{"$t":"2016-09-03T08:16:22.737-07:00"},"title":{"type":"text","$t":"Anger Management"},"content":{"type":"html","$t":"\u003Cdiv dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" trbidi=\"on\"\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003EI am 21, and a very calm \u0026amp; gentle guy. I usually distance myself from an ugly situation. But sometimes, the flood gates just open. This happened a couple of months back.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E Near the EcoSpace signal, I got cut off by a Skoda driving very rashly. The driver of the Skoda almost drove me off the road into the road divider. I generally ignore such things and drive on, since in Bangalore it is normal. But that day I don't know what happened to me. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E I overtook the car, and blocked him off. My friend was with me \u0026amp; she tried to stop me from confronting him. But I got out and gestured the other driver to come out. He started arguing that he had switched on the indicators, and hence he was right (in driving me off the road). I was angry, shaking, and infuriated. And what happened next is something I wish I had not done. I opened the boot of my car and took out the car jack. And banged the car jack on the Skoda’s bonnet. TWICE. The driver  was scared to death. Since the driver’s window was open, I was about to use car jack to bash into driver's face when I saw he had two children (aged about 5 and 9 years) in the back seat. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E I stood there confused \u0026amp; angry at myself. The driver of the Skoda sped off as if he had escaped death. I walked back slowly to my car. That incident changed me forever. I still cannot forget the fear I saw on the driver's face and his 2 kids. And my friend was aghast. She couldn't believe what I had just done, because she'd never really seen me do anything like this before. I felt miserable for days after this incident.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003E How do you manage to be cool in various situations? \u003C\/b\u003ESome situations can be challenging, as the one above was. They can cause us to lose control, feel angry, disturbed and then react as a result. The problem with this behavior is that we are giving away our control to the other person. Keeping control and staying calm is especially important in times of disagreement, stress \u0026amp; anger. We could say or do anything at a time like this and be completely unaware of it until later when the repercussions would have to be considered. For eg. \u0026nbsp;The driver could have been carrying a firearm \u0026amp; might as well have shot me if he thought that his life was in danger. The situation could have turned into a legal problem if the driver wanted to press charges, since I damaged his vehicle \u0026amp; threatened him with bodily harm. \u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cb\u003EWhat should you do to remain calm in tough situations? \u003C\/b\u003EAssess the situation and try to see the bigger picture. Had I been willing to let go of this \u0026amp; understand why the driver cut me off, this would have never happened. Do not react at that instant. If you have to answer someone, take a moment to think about it. Nowadays, if I am angry at someone\/something, I just excuse myself \u0026amp; go to the powder room. It calms me down \u0026amp; gives me more time to react. Discussion, negotiation and compromise can follow if you stay calm, since this allows other to stay calm too. The Skoda's driver was arguing with me but in a mild manner. Had I also been more calm, this would never have happened. Relationships remain intact and even improve when people prove that they can work together respectfully through rough situations and achieve a sensible result. Some wise man once said that holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.\u003Cbr \/\u003E \u003Cbr \/\u003EI read this anecdote somewhere, though i can't seem to remember it.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cblockquote class=\"tr_bq\"\u003EOne day I hopped in a taxi and we took off for the airport. We were driving in the right lane when suddenly a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver slammed on his brakes, skidded, and missed the other car by just inches! The driver of the other car whipped his head around and started yelling at us. My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. And I mean, he was really friendly. So I asked, ‘Why did you just do that? This guy almost ruined your car and sent us to the hospital!’ This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call, ‘The Law of the Garbage Truck.’\u003Cbr \/\u003E He explained that many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump it, and sometimes they’ll dump it on you.

And it came in form of Shoojit Sircar’s endearing and pensive drama-comedy ‘Piku’. To be frank, some of us in the gang were planning for Bombay Velvet. And since I don’t like typical Bollywood masala flicks, I decided to go with Piku. And God-oh god, what a sweet surprise it turned out to be. More importantly, it made me reconsider my relationship with my father as well.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EPiku is the story of a Delhi-based Bengali family’s hypochondriac, self-centered, part-senile 70 year-old man, Bhaskor Bannerjee (Amitabh Bachchan), with the compulsively chronic condition of constipation and his firm, stubborn, annoyed daughter, Piku Bannerjee (Deepika Padukone) – who frequently quarrel over ‘motion’ issues of the former.\u0026nbsp;t a slice-of-life movie which deals with how a daughter, extremely busy in her work life as an architect, is doubling up as her 70 year old father's babysitter. How she deals with her father's tantrums everyday which involves tackling his arch nemesis - constipation. Both have an unconditional love towards each other, but being stubborn and head-strong as individuals, they have a disagreement on most of the trivial issues with neither of them buckling down.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003C\/div\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003EThe film has a very realistic and candid quality, just like Shoojit Sircar’s previous “Vicky Donor. The direction is impeccable. The subtle relationship and mutual feelings that develop between Irrfan and Deepika are very well portrayed and the director has kept this relationship open ended. Kudos for avoiding a conclusion on that relation in a conventional way. You may notice that when the real-estate broker flies in from Kolkata, he has an airline tag on his bag. This shows the attention to detail by Sircar.\u0026nbsp;Words cannot do justice to the performance put up by the cast. Amitabh's portrayal of Bhaskor Banerjee is sincerely endearing and irritating enough to do justice to the character. And to the champion who gets things done easily, nicely and effortlessly- Irrfan Khan. That one scene where he goes to pick the family in the morning when the driver opts to disappear, he sits quiet and Deepika comes out to sit in front seat. You can watch it again and again, no words exchanged but the viewer totally understands and gives a sarcastic laughter. And the surprise package includes the sweet Mausami Chatterjee, with her never get rude attitude and ready to reply character. The good old Raghubir Yadav as the wonderful family homeopathic doctor. Even Jisshu Sengupta as Syed was very apt for his role. However, the scene-stealer is Deepika Padukone, who has really come a long way as an actor, and delivers a neat, matured performance. She’s fire and ice. You’ll fall in love with her. I was reminded of my physics teacher back in school, Moushmi Chatterjee; a lady who could be almost be described as ‘Piku’. The portrayal of the Bengali family as a whole is extremely realistic. And I can tell you this because I have lived in a predominantly Bengali neighborhood in a city with a high population of Bengalis. My teachers in Carmel High were Bengali as well as the local tuitions (Prasanjeet \u0026amp; pramanik, anyone?).

And finally, a few words about the director of photography. Kamaljeet Sir, you deserve an award for representing the cities of Kolkata and Delhi. Having lived in Kolkata for some time, I can assure you that it is one of the best depictions of the city in recent times (Kahaani as well).

Having an old, pre-historic phone, a Blackberry. Yes, for years I had clung to the original smartphone, while the rest of the world moved on. But there comes a time when you have to decide between turning the page and closing the book.

And my BBM contact list has come down to 3 or 4 people. Most of them have moved on to Whatsapp. The only thing that was keeping me from switching was the physical keyboard. While I could swear by the accuracy \u0026amp; speed of a physical keyboard over a touch-based one, shifting to touch wasn’t much of an issue since I had used a Galaxy Tab 2 for over 2 years. So, that left just the email, BIS and security. As far as security was concerned, android provided a basic level of encryption which was good enough for me. Also, I wouldn't be wrong if I said that Gmail™ has become the de-facto choice for mails today (not considering corporate accounts), and what better ecosystem to handle it than Android itself. And by overlooking these trivial issues, I was getting a great app eco-system (Play Store), an up-to-date OS and a modern looking device, albeit less professional.

I selected the same no alerts option on my Moto and holstered the phone. Midway through the speech of a certain Dr. Alexandre Durant, the Moto’s alarm started sounding loudly. Turns out that the alarms do not silence themselves even if the ringer is silenced. Now there are 2 things you should know about this tone. One, it’s a highly unprofessional tone. Two, this Moto does not ring incrementally. It goes ballistic all of a sudden. Imagine my plight when Mr. Alexandre actually stopped his speech and waited for me to silence my phone. And I fumbled with the buttons, trying the power\/ volume buttons \u0026amp; finally realizing that you had to drag a bloody icon from one end to other just to silence the phone.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003EIncident 2: \u003C\/b\u003EI told a friend (whom I\u0026nbsp;didn't\u0026nbsp;want to talk to at that moment) that I had internals \u0026amp;\u0026nbsp;would not be able to chat with her that night.

No, the ticks in Whatsapp don’t stand for D \u0026amp; R. 1 tick stands for ‘Message delivered to server’ and 2 ticks specify ‘message delivered to device’. So, if you've been upset with your boyfriend for not responding to your message despite the two ticks and you are assuming he has read it but is busy flirting with someone else, chances are he has not. While BBM can't tell you if he is indeed cheating on you, it can tell you with certainty that the message has been read and not just delivered.\u0026nbsp;\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003EI tried installing BBM on my Moto but it’s too crude and buggy.

I spent my entire high school years wishing that I could be away from my parents, unhindered, the way I wanted myself to be.\u0026nbsp;While preparing myself to go to college was probably one of the most exciting times of my life, it was bittersweet since it meant saying goodbye to my home; simultaneously preparing for this huge next phase in my life, which, I can tell you for certain, contained some of my worst and loneliest moments.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003EThe weight of my solitude didn’t settle completely until the exact moment I left my house. As the door of the car was held open by my younger brother, I threw a longing glance back at my home. I then sank into the rear seat. Then immediately, the cars drove out, with another car carrying my mom and aunt following us. I had left Jamshedpur earlier, sometimes even for long periods, knowing that I would probably return within a week or two. But there was something different this time. This time it felt much more difficult, painful and tragic.\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003E\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\"\u003EJamshedpur doesn’t have an airport, so I had to go to Ranchi to catch a flight. My parents, due to time constraints, couldn't accompany me all the way. So they dropped me at the station, where I was supposed to catch the train to Ranchi. Frankly, at that moment I even thought that this was better since it would save me a lot of emotional drama at the airport. I was wrong, dead wrong.

I hugged him but somehow controlled my tears, since I was young and had to maintain my image of being a ‘tough guy’. The train suddenly whistled.

For some, this may be difficult to believe. It will sound stale and clichéd because so many people have already told you this. You've convinced yourself, you won't be like that.
