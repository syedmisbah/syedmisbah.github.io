                <p>This site is a collection of things that make up my life—what I read, what I write about AI, and other musings. It's a small glimpse into my process of continuous learning and adjustment.</p>
                <p>I am a Data Science & Engg. Manager at Dish, where I build classical ML and AI solutions. Previously, I worked at Evalueserve and Mu Sigma as a lead data scientist.</p>
