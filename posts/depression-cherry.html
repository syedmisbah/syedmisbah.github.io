            <p>Did you ever hear an album that feels like an emotional punch in the gut? Something that squeezes your innards until you want to collapse into a puddle of overwrought, bawling mess on the floor? Sure you have Nick Drake, Elliot Smith, Jeff Buckley, and The Zombies have all done it to me in the past. Songs so overwhelmingly heartfelt and painful you can't help but barely keep it together. Then you see some commercial for the ASPCA on TV and you have to go "get something out of your eye" in the bathroom for a few minutes. I've been there, man. Hell, we've all been there. Beach House have been bringing us dreamy, melancholy, and slightly druggy albums in the key of "sigh" for a few years now. Ever since Devotion, each record has excelled at surpassing the previous one’s grandeur and lamenting nature. Depression Cherry isn't changing the formula, but it has refined their wispy sound to a fine, hazy moan. If you're new to Beach House, don't let all the sappy, sad sack stuff dissuade you from hitting play on their new long player, or any of their albums for that matter. They're pieces of artful beauty.</p>

            <p>Alex Scally and Victoria LeGrand form the whole of Beach House, and they work together wonderfully. LeGrand has one of those timeless voices. It's a dark, smoky voice that gives the impression of years of good and bad; stories float within her cadences and lazy delivery. It's a voice that's aged much quicker than LeGrand's merely 34 years. Alex Scally creates these curtains of slow motion revelations in the music, which only accentuates the emotional heft LeGrand delivers. On Depression Cherry, Scally and LeGrand have given us a much needed autumn album. Songs filled with sage advice about love, life, and beyond. The passage of time and getting older is felt on these songs. "Levitation" slowly finds its way into focus like the ocean waves hitting the shore. There's no rushing to any conclusions. There's always a sense of heightened perception in a Beach House song. Like slow motion psychedelia. A giddy calliope carries you on some strange trip, with the gray of reality always in the distance. "Sparks" is the most upbeat song on the album, and possibly in the entire Beach House canon. With the most distorted guitar I've ever heard (or noticed) in a Beach House song, and with the melding of Scally and LeGrand's voices this song almost brings a Medicine vibe to mind. "Space Song" floats along nicely with a great slide guitar, steady bass, and some synth strings. Victoria LeGrand emotes wonderfully as always. This is the kind of song you'd play for someone new to the Beach House world and say "This is what they sound like."</p>

            <p>There's always been a Cocteau Twins sound with Beach House. Maybe not "exactly" like Cocteau Twins, but they both create this ethereal music that feels like AM pop music from some other alternate universe. It's both sad and happy. Beach House make sad music for happy people. "Beyond Love", "PPP", and "Wildflower" all hit hard in the gut, pushing the air from your lungs like a bit of sad news. But somehow, it's never depressing. Much like the same reason you sit and listen to songs like The Beatles' "In My Life", The Zombies' "The Way I Feel Inside", or Nick Drake's "Way to Blue", we somehow need that down to get back up. Maybe we're masochists at heart. Maybe I am. Either way, Beach House capture that longing we crave beautifully, and "Days of Candy" is one of the most beautifully written and arranged songs you'll hear all year. With an almost Brian Wilson-meets-10CC sound, this song aches and creaks like an old love. It's like walking through a childhood home and seeing hints of the past in every corner. It's a truly breathtaking song, and one you won't soon forget. After multiple listens so far, here is a track by track review of one of the most beautiful and emotional albums I've heard.</p>

            <p>1. Levitation: This song slowly builds up the atmosphere with keyboards and minor drum beats. Victoria’s angelic vocals glide through. At first I didn't think the singing was as good as others but after repeated listens I found myself singing 'There’s a place I want to take you' in my head. The second half features an emotional guitar croon that creeps in perfectly to complete the soundscape before fading away nicely. The title of the song explains how it feels listening to this perfectly. Amazing opener. 10/10</p>

            <p>2. Sparks: The lead single. At first I wasn't that impressed. But the song just kept getting better and better. It is a very spacey song that again sounds just as the title implies. The vocals in the first half remind me of M83. Then toward the end Victoria’s distinct lullaby style brings it to a close. The main riff is so alluring. By the time the main riff repeats itself one final time it sounds like a friend departing whom you wished would stay longer. Each time I listen to this song I feel like I'm saying goodbye to someone I love. It's so profound the way music can make you feel. Especially when done right like this. 10/10</p>

            <p>3. Space Song: This sounds like it could've been on Bloom. I fell in love with this at first listen and it has only grown more and more on me. It's just so great all around. The main riff on this one is so gorgeous it's hard to describe. I would have to say it sounds tragically beautiful. Like endlessly floating through the night while the one you love is floating a distance in front of you that you can never catch up to. I know, it sounds depressing, but not in the mopey way at all. Oh and Victoria’s vocals of course are so sensual and perfect. This is a new favorite. This is one of those songs I could never get tired of. 11/10</p>

            <p>4. Beyond Love: Another song with a tragic beauty in its sound as if the title didn't hint at it. The lyrics are so eerie yet delivered so smoothly. Victoria really is beyond human in her vocal abilities. The main riff is sad in a good way. Think of your lover or the one that got away while listening. Or just relax and enjoy. Another great track. 9.5/10</p>

            <p>5. 10:37: The beginning drums sound like the introduction to a ceremony. Then the vocals slowly soar through the song. This one keeps that Cocteau Twins comparison strong. Such a relaxing song. The guitar are so simple yet elegantly great. I always picture myself floating down a mystic river on giant lily pads staring up at the stars when listening to this. But that’s just me. Great playful relaxation song. 9.5/10</p>

            <p>6. PPP: This song. Wow. The main riff. The way Victoria talks seductively in the beginning before singing so beautifully that I feel like I'm drowning in divine delight. The melody of this song can either make you cry or feel exceptionally happy, or both. The eerie guitar solo is just so beautiful gorgeous haunting elegant. I can't even really put to words how it makes me feel. This song is sure to be a emotional roller coaster throughout the years. This one is an instant classic. If I was a filmmaker I'd want this to be in my movie. 11/10</p>

            <p>7. Wildflower: The synth and guitar in this one brings to mind the 80s. A quick but twinkling song that I wish was twice as long. Just sit back and let this one guide your thoughts. Another relaxation gem. 9.5/10</p>

            <p>8. Bluebird: Another one that I strongly wish was longer. This is a jam. Everything is perfect again. The drums. The staccato style guitars that just glide through the chorus. The keyboards. Victoria’s heavenly croon. I am constantly amazed with this one. This is the sound definition of good music. Love it. 10.5/10</p>

            <p>9. Days of Candy: I read that the band used a choir of 24 for this song and it really shows. The beginning is slow and haunting in the way she sings. Then the drums quietly kick in with some great emotional guitars. The final 2 minutes of the song are the best. It sounds like 3 separate songs yet one song at the same time. Such a great and endearing way to close this emotional masterpiece of an album. 10/10.</p>

            <p>Depression Cherry is a triumph of mood and emotion. You don't need to know what Victoria LeGrand is singing to be moved by her. There's a certain solace in sad songs. I guess it's knowing that you're not the only one going through it. Depression Cherry is the voice in the abyss telling you you're not alone.</p>
