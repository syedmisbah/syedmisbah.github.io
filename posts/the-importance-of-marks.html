            <p>Okay so people have been posting a lot about marks and board results in the last few days. They've basically sugar-coated their bullshit and have tried saying things that youngsters would like to hear. Although I do agree with the fact that your marks don't really matter in the end, the way it's being told is downright stupid. </p>

            <p>You obviously don't need good grades if you're talented. But here's the thing - Most of you guys aren't. Your parents/teachers/friends might have told you good things about yourself but most of them are wrong. It takes way more than just talent to make it big. You think your marks don't matter? Tell that to a kid who won't be able to get into his/her dream college. </p>

            <p>Yes there are flaws in the education system but that doesn't change the fact that being an idiot is always unacceptable. Give your best in exams because they do fucking matter. Talent won't get you anywhere if you don't have access to a platform to showcase your thing. Top colleges in India provide you that platform. Getting good grades matter in that context. Not everyone is a talented (lucky?) motherfucker so you need to actually work hard and not listen to some random comedian about what he feels about your grades. </p>
